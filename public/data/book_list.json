        "description": "Music was an essential aspect of life in eighteenth-century Britain and plays a crucial role in the literary strategies of Georgian novels. This book is the first to investigate the literary representation of music in these works and explores the structural, dramatic and metaphorical roles of music in novels by authors ranging from Richardson to Austen. Pierre Dubois explores the meaning of 'musical scenes' by framing them within contemporary cultural issues, such as the critique of Italian opera or the theoretical shift from mimesis to the alleged autonomy and mystery of music. Focusing upon both eighteenth-century theories of music, and the way specific musical instruments were perceived in the collective imagination, Dubois suggests new interpretative perspectives for a whole range of novels of the Georgian era. This book will be of interest to a wide readership interested not only in literature, but also in music and cultural history at large.",

She thought getting her Master's Degree in Music Business would be her ticket to the top, but it turns out managers are a dime a dozen in Music City. With no other prospects and student loan repayments on the horizon, she takes an internship position under the devious Kitty Konstantine. The job was simple: find talent, introduce talent to Konstantine Talent Agency, and keep it all professional. When she finds The 4 Saints, she can see the men ooze with talent, their stage presence commanding rapt attention. When she lays eyes on Matt Saint, she knows she has no hope of keeping it professional... Matthew Saint has a lot on his shoulders, and he's got the scars to prove it. As guitarist for The 4 Saints, he and his brothers have to live in two worlds. On the one hand, they're up and coming country music stars just trying to make it in Nashville. On the other hand, they're a clan of Bear Shifters that have to be careful who they let get close. Trouble is never far off, and since meeting Mel Darlin', he thinks maybe he's due for a little more trouble in his life. This 12,000 word novella features a Happily Ever After, No Cheating, No Cliffhanger and lots of graphic primal hotness.",

So, the shop owner keeps to herself, staying busy with the day-to-day tasks of keeping her store afloat in the heart of the Ozarks. But the sound of a knock on her bedroom window changes everything. You never truly know how you will react to the demons in your life until you are face to face with them. Answering that knock leads to Reese Taylor: the man who spends his nights as the lead singer of the band New Leaf, while wanting to turn over one of his own. Take me home and take me without hesitation. Like I'm a song. Like I've never been a regret. What started as an encounter becomes more of an entanglement when a sense of safety disrupts their solitude. As their relationship deepens, echoes from a violent past threaten to break down everything they've rebuilt. Background Music is Book 2 of the Muse & Music Series. It can be read as a standalone.",

And not just on a university campus that is too large for her and a music program where she’s not sure that she belongs. She also feels as though she’s lost her purpose or that she never truly had one. Deep down, she knows that God has a plan for her. If she didn’t believe that then she truly would be lost. She just wishes that she could see that plan for herself. When she hires an accompanist to help her with her end of semester vocal audition for the University's performance program, she realizes that she is not the only one feeling lost. Though he tries to hide it behind a plain, pleasant exterior, Joanie knows that Noah Harding, her accompanist, has problems that she can’t even begin to imagine, starting with his distrust of Churches, Christians and the idea of God in general. In helping Noah find his faith, can Joanie discover her own purpose as well?",

        "description": "The story of Mello and June came to life through Kim’s reflections of three past relationships she was in. Through her reminiscing, while listening to her favorite R&B singer Anita Baker, she decided her past pain could make a great love story. She began going through her voluminous music collection and thumbed through thousands of titles of her favorite R&B songs, hence, Mello and June were born. Mello’s character is very controlling, arrogant, and at times downright cruel. On the other hand, June is very passive, loving, and extremely naïve. It has always been said that opposites attract, and that certainly is the case for these two very different characters. Their relationship spans for over fifty years of sheer madness between the two of them. Life takes them down totally to different paths, yet June is forced to make a decision that Mello has posed upon her. The love story of Mello and June is a dramatic story that will keep you turning the pages. What makes this novel different than any other, Kim used some of R&B’s classic music, as well as her artistry of writing, to tell their story. As you read the song chapters and you remember the songs that tell the story, it will immediately take the reader to special times in their lives, and smiles will begin to form. When you recall the lyrics to the titles of each chapter, the reader may think he or she will know right away what the chapter is about, but don’t let the song chapter fool you because Kim changed up what the chapters are about to put a spin on the book. This is definitely a novel that is a must-have and will be a great addition to your book collection, and one that you will be talking about for years to come.",

It’s December and the magic of Christmas is swelling in the heart of her hometown of Redford. The holidays look different this year as she struggles to balance her work and home life. This is her favorite time of year, but the usual traditions she enjoyed with her parents are in the past. Fighting for the Creative Director position, a huge step up from jingle writer, Andrea must organize the annual Angel Wings Choral Festival to prove to her boss that she’s ready for the responsibility. Enter Lucas, a shy but charming schoolteacher who is new in town and loves Christmas almost as much as Andrea does. Neither of them want a relationship, but Lucas’ actions tell Andrea another story. Could he be the inspiration she’s been looking for? Their friendship blooms, but thanks to a meddling mother, they both question what they truly desire from one another. With the festival quickly approaching and Andrea caught between a man and her career, will she discover the happy ending she deserves?",

The best talents as a violinist: she was born with them. A pampered life of chauffeurs and private jets. So why was she now on the run, trying to hide herself in the one place she knew her father would never look for her? John might have the last name of Saint, but his family swears he made a deal with the Devil. Not one person from Ozarks to the Appalachias could strum a mandolin like him. And while he loved the harmonies he helped his family achieve on stage, he always felt something was missing inside. Until that night she came into The Fiddler's Cave, and for the first time in his life he thought there might be someone who felt like he did. This 13,000+ word novella has hot Country Music Bear Shifter action, a Happily Ever After, no cheating and no cliffhangers!",

But there’s one person who stands in her way. “It`s a no from me,” Antonio Machiavelli. When Antonio’s auditions for a lead principal end in wintry Cape Town, the last thing he expects is to have more than a knee-jerk reaction to an audition. Ashley not only verbally challenges him, but also translates her fire and cheekiness into an edge of your seat performance. Can Antonio keep his distance from Ashley? Can Ashley focus on fulfilling her dream of becoming a lead principal? Or will love have its way?",

But the title that always trips her up is \"daughter.\" No matter what she achieved, her father was always ready to cut her down. Even now that she's signed The Four Saints, it's still not good enough. Now, if she can't get them signed under a tighter contract, she'll lose everything. Bart Saint was pure swagger. He had that level of arrogance that couldn't be earned, so only the very few could pull it off. Tall? Sure. Handsome? Oh yeah. But it was something else that made heads turn when he walked into a room. He knew exactly who he was, and that made him invincible. He was manager to his nephews, and he'd be damned if he let Kitty Konstantine put the squeeze to them. Let the battle of wills begin. May the most stubborn negotiator win. This 12,000+ word novella has hot Country Music Bear Shifter action, a Happily Ever After, no cheating and no cliffhangers!",

Her love rules have thankfully saved her from dealing with messy relationship complications. But since R & B superstar Dante Wilson hired her to open his new Malibu nightclub, he's determined to add some pleasure to their business dealings. And Julie's strategy to protect her heart may not stand up to his seductive appeal. Growing up in a music dynasty, Dante enjoys all the female attention that comes with his fame. For the first time, he knows what it feels like to be brushed off by someone he's falling for. When his usual moves fall flat, he has to show Julie the real man behind all the glitz and glamour. Will it be enough to convince Julie that it's better to break the rules rather than risk losing love's passionate melody?",

Sophie Love is a natural storyteller. LOVE LIKE THIS is very well written and edited, and I highly recommend it to the permanent library of all readers that appreciate a romance that can be savored during a weekend.” --Books and Movie Reviews (Roberto Mattos) LOVE LIKE OURS (The Romance Chronicles—Book #3) is book #3 in a new romance series by #1 bestselling author Sophie Love. The series begins with LOVE LIKE THIS (Book #1), a free download! Keira Swanson, 28, returns to New York City, this time with Cristiano in tow. Having him in New York, and having him meet her family, is culture shock for them both. Keira is soon assigned a new article, her most important yet: a 30 day trip to Paris—with Cristiano in tow. Her assignment: to find out if their love can last in a foreign country, on new ground for them both. As Keira and Cristiano take the romantic trip of a lifetime to Paris, they find their love tested in unexpected ways. When a surprise twist comes their way, everything changes. Can their love withstand it? A whirlwind romantic comedy that is as profound as it is funny, LOVE LIKE OURS is book #3 in a dazzling new romance series that will make you laugh, cry, and will keep you turning pages late into the night—and will make you fall in love with romance all over again. Book #4 is also now available! “Sophie Love's ability to impart magic to her readers is exquisitely wrought in powerfully evocative phrases and descriptions….[This is] the perfect romance or beach read, with a difference: its enthusiasm and beautiful descriptions offer an unexpected attention to the complexity of not just evolving love, but evolving psyches. It's a delightful recommendation for romance readers looking for a touch more complexity from their romance reads.” --Midwest Book Review (Diane Donovan re: For Now and Forever)",

The flannel? The guitar? Claire isn't sure, but Jack is simply irresistible. It's no wonder she pushes him to audition for a local singing contest. You're never too old to chase your dreams, right? Music was Jack's first love. When life got in the way of him making it big as a singer/songwriter, he settled for teaching music--including giving piano lessons to a stunning curvy redhead named Claire. He's fallen head over heels for her--just in time for his big break to finally arrive. But do you ever really give up on your first love? Music Man is part of the Romance in Rehoboth series. If you like your romcoms sweet, funny, and semi-clean, if you enjoy a small town setting, and you have a penchant for strong, curvy, and somewhat snarky heroines, you're gonna want to move to Rehoboth Beach by the time you're done reading. Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, that is. It's a real place, and Delaware has great beaches. Who knew? Trust me, I'm just as surprised as you are! These can be read in any order, but if you're the type who has to start a book 1, here's the chronological order: Book 1: Music Man (Claire and Jack's Story) Book 2: The Flip (Sonnet and Drew's Story) Book 3: Plot Twist (Lindy and Meric's Story) Book 4: Badge Bunny (Brynne and Chris's Story) Book 5: Wedding War (Hannah and Jason's Story) Book 6: Stage Mom (Larissa and Mateo's Story) Book 7: Shark Bite (Megan and Shark's Story)",

        "description": "HARMONY and STEVE draw closer and spiritual war wages when heaven meets hell. Christian contemporary singing sensation, daughter of Christian radio and media family counselor icons, HARMONY HARPER, has spent her entire life serving God. From teen sensation to celebrated adult Christian contemporary music artist, she regularly plays sold-out concerts everywhere she goes. Nearing thirty, and nearing burnout, Harmony heads to her mountain cabin hideaway to commune with Christ and compose some new music. Hard rocker STEVE SLAYER faces an ultimatum: keep rocking life the hard way and watch his organs fail due to addictions, or, sober up – for real this time – and live. Hiding out in the mountains of Oregon, he spends weeks detoxing. Finally strong enough to venture into town, he comes face to face with Harmony. Over the next several weeks, the two become unlikely friends as Steve learns to love and trust God, and mutual attraction surprises them both. Once news of their budding romance reaches the world, no one is happy. Not her people – not his people. Then letters written in blood start arriving. An attack on a concert threatens more than just their lives. Harmony and Steve realize the threats might just be real. Can Harmony and Steve discover who wants to destroy them, or will the enemy bring their house down in a dissonance that strikes at their very souls? ********************** bridgeman, christian, christian drama, christian family drama, christian fiction, christian love story, christian mystery, christian romance, christian romantic mystery, christian romantic suspense, christian romantic thriller, christian suspense, christian thriller, contemporary, contemporary christian, contemporary christian fiction, contemporary christian romance, contemporary christian suspense, contemporary drama, contemporary inspirational fiction, contemporary inspirational romance, contemporary inspirational suspense, contemporary love story, contemporary suspense, drama, dramatic christian, dramatic christian fiction, dramatic christian romance, dramatic christian suspense, dramatic inspirational fiction, dramatic inspirational romance, dramatic inspirational suspense, dramatic love story, dramatic suspense, edgy christian fiction, edgy christian romance, edgy inspirational fiction, edgy inspirational romance, fiction, God, hailey bridgeman, haley bridgeman, halle bridgeman, hallee bridgeman, Holy Spirit, inspirational, inspirational christian fiction, inspirational fiction, inspirational romance, inspirational suspense, Jesus, love, love story, olivia kimbrell press, romance, romantic christian, romantic christian fiction, romantic christian romance, romantic christian suspense, romantic drama, romantic inspirational fiction, romantic inspirational suspense, romantic inspirational thriller, romantic love story, romantic suspense, romantic themes, suspenseful drama, traditional love story, traditional romance, traditional suspense, Christian music superstar, Christian family legacy, family legacy, Christian artist, hard rocker, drug addiction, drug abuse, alcoholism, dependency, satanic worship, devil worship, satanic cult, acid rock, secret society, pregnancy, marriage, redemption, salvation, love",

When powerful and charismatic painter Lord Malrec brings newly-unemployed music teacher Alannys Gale to Ravanmark, it seems to be the answer to her prayers. Ravanmark is like a beautiful fairy tale. But it keeps trying to kill her. Lord Malrec has plans for her...plans that may not be as noble as they appear. Power plays and politics surround her from the first breath she draws there. And it looks like the biggest player of all...may be her. In a land with magic whose true power is shrouded in the mists of time, an ordinary woman must save the world...to save herself. The Music Mage is the first book in the epic fantasy romance series The Ravanmark Saga. These are books in the \"doorstopper\" tradition, and each novel in the series so far is longer than the ones before. If you are looking for a rich, detailed fantasy world you can immerse yourself in, look no further than Ravanmark!",

        "description": "A bundle of books #3 (LOVE LIKE OURS) and #4 (LOVE LIKE THEIRS) in Sophie Loves’s The Romance Chronicles series. This bundle offers books #3 and #4 in one convenient file, with over 150,000 words of reading. In LOVE LIKE OURS, Keira Swanson, returns to New York City, this time with Cristiano in tow. Having him in New York, and having him meet her family, is culture shock for them both. Keira is soon assigned a new article, her most important yet: a 30 day trip to Paris—with Cristiano in tow. Her assignment: to find out if their love can last in a foreign country, on new ground for them both. As Keira and Cristiano take the romantic trip of a lifetime to Paris, they find their love tested in unexpected ways. When a surprise twist comes their way, everything changes. Can their love withstand it? In LOVE LIKE THEIRS, Keira has sworn off of love. With her heart still hurting from her breakups with Cristiano and Shane, she will not allow her magazine to use her for another love experiment. Which is fine by them, because they want to send her off on a different kind of trip: to prove that someone suffering from a breakup can avoid a knee-jerk rebound affair and manage NOT to fall in love. To emphasize the point, they will NOT assign her a new tour guide. Instead, Keira will take a cruise to the Scandinavian countries and have to navigate herself. Keira is thrilled to accept the assignment. There is nothing she wants more than to be alone, and go to the Northern climes, where she can cool her head, and where surely she will not find love. But Keira does not anticipate the beauty of Copenhagen and of Stockholm (“the Paris of the North”) or the stunning hospitality of the Scandinavians. With Christmas on the way, resisting a new love may be harder than she thinks…. A whirlwind romantic comedy that is as profound as it is funny, THE ROMANCE CHRONICLES will make you laugh, cry, and will keep you turning pages late into the night—and will make you fall in love with romance all over again.",

        "description": "There’s nothing quite like love to flip a man’s world upside down… Don’t miss a single classic story in this collection from #1 New York Times bestselling author Linda Lael Miller. State Secrets Cookbook author Holly Llewellyn is the last person who should be labeled an “enemy of the state”—or is she? After all, her brother is a missing traitor, and with her ties to the president, the Secret Service isn’t taking chances. So they send in agent David Goddard, undercover. But after one glance, David knows Holly isn’t just an “assignment”—she’s a woman who’ll change his life. Mixed Messages Mark wasn’t sure the beautiful and spirited Carly had what it took to be a reporter, but he was sure that he wanted her. And Mark never denied himself what he wanted. Only Carly was far better at uncovering the truth than Mark had given her credit for. And sooner or later she’d uncover the most dangerous truth of all—that he couldn’t live without her. Only Forever Up-and-coming TV personality Vanessa Lawrence has learned the hard way that jocks are bad news. Her cheating ex-husband is a prime example—and now he won’t stop demanding permission to write lies about her in his tell-all memoir. So when sexy, confident athlete Nick strides into her life, she should have known he’d be nothing but trouble… Used-To-Be Lovers Tony Morelli had always pursued the things he wanted with single-minded tenacity and authority. It had been a very successful strategy in business, and it had been just as successful with Sharon Harrison. But when their perfect romance falls apart, it’ll take everything he has to win her back. Originally published in 1985, 1990, 1989, and 1988",

But as the last unmarried grandchild, he’s the favorite target of his matchmaker grandmother—and the only way to end her constant meddling is to set her up with someone of her own. Someone like Marshall Rayburn, the man she was engaged to more than sixty years ago, who is now a widower—and the grandfather of a very pretty, proper, and eligible bachelorette. Hilary Rayburn doesn’t need to spend an evening with the impossibly arrogant Devlin to know that he’s bad news—no matter how handsome he may be. And yet his plan to reunite lost lovers is too good to pass up. Hilary and Devlin will pretend they’re a match, bring their grandparents together, and watch the magic happen. But after getting one sweet taste of trouble with her partner in crime, Hilary can’t help wondering whether they should turn their charade into a reality.",

        "description": "From Sherlock Holmes to Sam Spade; Nick and Nora Charles to Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin; Harry Lime to Gilda, Madeleine Elster, and other femmes fatales—crime and crime solving in fiction and film captivate us. Why do we keep returning to Agatha Christie's ingenious puzzles and Raymond Chandler's hard-boiled murder mysteries? What do spy thrillers teach us, and what accounts for the renewed popularity of morally ambiguous noirs? In The Mysterious Romance of Murder, the poet and critic David Lehman explores a wide variety of outstanding books and movies—some famous (The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity), some known mainly to aficionados—with style, wit, and passion. Lehman revisits the smoke-filled jazz clubs from the classic noir films of the 1940s, the iconic set pieces that defined Hitchcock's America, the interwar intrigue of Eric Ambler's best fictions, and the intensity of attraction between Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer, Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. He also considers the evocative elements of noir—cigarettes, cocktails, wisecracks, and jazz standards—and offers five original noir poems (including a pantoum inspired by the 1944 film Laura) and ironic astrological profiles of Barbara Stanwyck, Marlene Dietrich, and Graham Greene. Written by a connoisseur with an uncanny feel for the language and mood of mystery, espionage, and noir, The Mysterious Romance of Murder will delight fans of the genre and newcomers alike.",

And the sparks are flying. Wait. Eli Robinson? How’s it possible the irritating younger brother of my best friend has morphed into this gorgeous swaggering man? I can’t let myself be tempted. Eli is off-limits. My best friend, his sister who helped raise him, makes sure I know it. Except the more I get to know him, the more difficult it is to stay away. This can only end badly. No relationship is worth losing my best friend. And then he kidnaps me. Eli Once upon a time, Jenna Larsen was my teenaged dream girl, and I mean that in the dirtiest way possible.

The moment Sawyer Bell picks up her fiddle, magic happens. Beautiful and wildly talented, Sawyer is the perfect match for Vix’s band—and, just maybe, for Vix. The dynamic in any group is a delicate thing, but with Sawyer and Vix thrown together on tour, it’s not long before the line between bandmates and lovers gets a bit blurry. The indie rock life is not what Sawyer ever saw for herself. She worked hard to get where she is—in her second year of Julliard, with a bright future in classical music. But instead of spending her summer working and rehearsing, she’s on tour with her secret high school crush. And even though it was only supposed to be temporary, Sawyer feels like she’s finally found a place she belongs. This summer with Vix has been like a dream. But every tour must come to an end, and when Julliard comes calling, Sawyer will need to make a choice: continue on the path she’s chosen, or take a leap of faith and follow her heart. One-click with confidence. This title is part of the Carina Press Romance Promise: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise! This book is approximately 63,000 words",

But the publicity leads to unwelcome attention from a competitor who slams Sabrina for being single. And, hello, stupid mistakes! Sabrina panics in the middle of an interview and claims she’s in a relationship with the friend she secretly lusts for—Logan Campbell. Steamed is an understatement when Logan’s long-distance relationship is derailed the moment Sabrina announces they’re a couple on TV. Way to throw him under the bus! The pressure’s on as Logan heads to California to repair his shaky relationship and navigate investor meetings for his tech company. Sabrina knows she’s got to undo the damage, but when she meets the rotten cheating apple of Logan’s eye, she knows there’s only one thing for her to do…make another stupid mistake.",

        "description": "Several years ago, Lea Finn walked away from her big-city corporate career. She bought a Key West–style home in Bradenton, Florida, and spent her days kayaking, swimming, and lounging in a hammock. Her nights were filled with sizzling romance and tales of adventure in idyllic locations. And of course, a few hours of sleep! The only flaw in her newfound perfect lifestyle was the dead lady's house next door, or so she thought...KC Bradlow is a prominent attorney. He is known for his professionalism, eye for detail, and superior trial skills. The consensus according to the legal secretaries across Bradenton: he is an absolute and total hunk. The \"grapevine\" was usually focused on the hearsay of who he was or wasn't sleeping with at the moment. And KC, at times, liked to fuel the secretaries wagging tongues. Who better to help him with the speculations was none other than his sister and fellow attorney, Kristianna Romanoff? But there are some who are not interested in the exquisite but unattainable body of KC Bradlow. Rather, they could think of no greater pleasure than to wipe the smile from his beautiful face and end his perfect life...KC is a smart attorney. Can he figure out how to stop the destruction of everything he loves and holds dear to him before his time runs out?",

        "description": "She’s the steady pulse in my veins. Mallory burst into my life like glittering gold in a concrete jungle. We’ve fought hard and survived the biggest obstacles in our relationship. At least that’s what I thought. The band should be headed for platinum status. Instead, new threats emerge from the most unlikely places. It’s impossible to tell who’s a friend and who’s about to stick a knife in my back. Suddenly, taking the easy road seems a lot more alluring. He’s my vigilant protector. Rock & roll might have been Chaser’s first love, but I never doubt his devotion to me. I’m always his priority. But protecting me at all costs drives him to reckless acts, so now it’s my turn to keep him safe. I’m willing to do whatever it takes, whether that means seeking help from Chaser’s father and the Devil Demons MC or visiting my father in prison. Hollywood won’t tear us apart. Together we’ll struggle to hold on to what matters most—each other. I’ll fight for my man with everything I am, even if I have to drag him through hell to the other side. Blow My Fuse is the second book in the Hollywood Demons series by USA Today bestselling author Autumn Jones Lake. It is meant to be read after Kickstart my Heart. TOPICS: rock stars, rockstars, romance, 1980s, heavy metal music, addiction, recovery, opposites attract romance, glamour, seedy hollywood, actress, hollywood tales, action, outlaw motorcycle clubs, motorcycle club romance, music scene, hard rock, television stars, nostalgia",

She's a pampered rich girl, thinking she can get anything she wants, whenever she wants. It pisses me off. I've struggled to survive, and I have the scars to prove it. Delaney’s going to make me a wealthy man, once her parents pay to get their precious angel back. But every time I look at those sassy lips, I wanna put them to good use. Delaney has gotten under my skin and she knows it. Even before I took her hostage, she'd somehow managed to work her way into my blood, and my heart hammers harder in my chest every time she stares daggers in my direction. She's craving someone like me in her life, whether she knows it or not, and with every bratty outburst, a part of me calls out to discipline her. She needs to be taught a lesson. And I need her, all to myself. I promised to ransom her off, but once I have a taste of her sweet curves, I'm keeping her to myself. She’s the hitman’s hostage and she’ll learn to love it.

        "description": "Welcome to Ocean Sands! This four book collection features the novels Starlit Sand, Golden Sand, Midnight Sand, and Exquisite Sand. Starlit Sand Can a sexy rockstar turn a one-night stand into forever? Workaholic family law attorney Lauren Catalano has been burned by love. But meeting a handsome stranger on the beach on the heels of her divorce, she can't ignore the passion he sparks. When Lauren learns her mystery man is rock superstar Noah Devereux, she’s convinced it’ll never last. But one night together turns into more and Lauren resists falling for a man who’s touched her heart in a way she never thought possible. Humiliated by his supermodel ex’s infidelity, Noah questions the worth of his fame and fortune if all it earns him are hollow relationships and betrayal. Lauren’s honesty and loyalty hit Noah hard and he starts to believe that Lauren’s the woman he needs in his life. Will Noah convince Lauren to believe in happily ever after or will their affair end in more heartbreak? Golden Sand Money can't buy what this billionaire desires most... Computer tycoon Dominic Russell has more money than he ever imagined, but he’s missing something that money can’t buy. When he meets Eden Bell, he’s intrigued by the down-on-her-luck waitress. A relentless competitor, Dominic sets his sights on winning her heart. Fiercely independent Eden Bell doesn’t believe in true love. She’s been burned before, and while Dominic’s attention is flattering, she doesn’t expect the committed bachelor to fall for her and her ready-made family. The charming entrepreneur proves hard to resist, and the two embark on a relationship that could change them both forever. But Eden’s been hiding a life-changing secret from Dominic, and if it comes to light, the truth could tear them apart. Midnight Sand One hot night and now she's carrying his baby... Sought-after bachelor Ethan Davenport has been in love only once—and when it ended in disaster, he swore to never let it happen again. The black sheep of his family, he does things his own way—alone. But a one-night stand opens his eyes to the woman who’s been there for him all along. Scarred from the past, Faith Bishop won’t ever tell Ethan how she feels about him. She tells herself they’re just friends…until one night changes everything. When she becomes pregnant with the billionaire’s baby, she can’t hold back her hopes for a real future with Ethan. Faith’s used to making it on her own, and she doesn’t know if she can trust Ethan to give her the family she’s never had. But Ethan won’t lose his friend and his baby in his life. He’ll do anything to prove to Faith that he’s changed…and she’s the reason why. Exquisite Sand It's about to get hot in the kitchen… Stacy Frederick’s rebuilt her life after the death of her husband, but her wrecked heart isn’t ready to love again. Even her intense attraction to celebrity chef William Blackwell, who’s spending the summer in Ocean Sands, can’t change her mind. She has other things to keep her busy, like saving the floundering restaurant where she works, and consequently securing the promotion that’s been dangled in front of her. William says he can respect Stacy’s boundaries. In Ocean Sands recovering after a battle of his own, he’s under strict orders to rest and recover. Spending a few weeks helping an old friend is just the distraction he needs. No drama is a good thing, and his finger-snap attraction to Stacy should burn itself out any day now… While working shoulder to shoulder, Stacy begins to fall for the handsome chef with Southern charm, and getting a second chance at love starts to feel irresistible...",

Jeff Blue made important decisions every day—what clothes to wear, what to eat for breakfast, and what book to teach his high school English class. What he never expected was needing to make a choice between repairing his failing marriage in 1981 or start anew with J0—an unexpected and flawless copy of his wife in 2095. 114 years in the future is nothing like he imagined and waking up there comes with its own list of questions. But while getting back to his time should be at the top of his list, it's hard to resist the new-and-improved version of his wife. J0's a clean slate. A chance to have things just the way he wants, to have things as they were before their daughter’s “accident.” However, staring at J0 reminds him of the woman he vowed for better or worse, left back in 1981. Armed with a one-way ticket to the moon, it's a race against the clock to seize his last chance to return home to his time. A time without hover cars, Justice Computers, TeleSkins—a time without J0. Is that what he really wants?",

        "description": "I swear I am not the kind of person who gets her cell phone caught in places that require an ER trip and an OBGYN. But, apparently, I am. I’m also not the kind of person who spends all her time thinking about the guy who got away. But, apparently, I am, too. Starting a new life in Boston isn’t supposed to include repeatedly embarrassing myself in public, meeting a crazy blond woman who has ties to the band Random Acts of Crazy, and definitely isn’t supposed to include wallowing in a past I thought I’d left behind four years ago. But, apparently, it does. And the drummer for the band, Sam Hinton, is the boy I loved in high school and who disappeared with my heart. Now he’s back, better than ever. Second chances aren’t supposed to make scars disappear and hearts mend. But, apparently, they can. If you trust enough. Fate took their lives by storm four years ago and put an unbreachable gulf between Sam and Amy. Can time really heal all wounds…or are some scars too deep? The second book in the Random series after the wildly successful New York Times and USA Today bestseller Random Acts of Crazy, Random Acts of Trust is a romantic comedy that explores the love between one man, one woman, and ends with one Happily Ever After (and no cliffhangers or chickens!). And you’ll never look at a cell phone the same way again. Listen to the audiobook, narrated by Sebastian York and Andi Arndt!! Topics: contemporary romance, romantic comedy, new adult romance, rockstar romance, rock star romance, erotic romance, seductive story, hot romance, women's fiction, women's romance, bbw romance, romance, contemporary woman julia kent, julia kent romance",

Full of self-discovery, romance, and angst, follow four couples as they navigate first love, heartbreak, and learn to put the past behind them. THE LIST The List. Twenty things every girl must do before she turns twenty... Body Piercing Get Drunk First Kiss But thanks to her crazy, over-protective father, Annie Roth is way behind schedule. Good thing it's her first semester of college, because Annie is more than ready to start checking off items... Fake ID Skinny Dipping Road Trip!!! Where it gets complicated? Ryan and Chris. Best friends. Both sweet, funny, totally hot, and totally into Annie.But there are some things on The List that Annie only wants to do with Ryan... Lose it Get heart broken Fall in love NO REGRETS College is supposed to be fun. Go to parties. Pick up guys. Maybe get in a little trouble. On the surface Cami is your average, wild teenager out to have a good time, but inside she’s struggling. Almost a year ago her best friend was in a car accident, an accident Cami feels responsible for. Since then, she’s made it her personal mission to experience everything life has to offer, both for herself and for Julie, who will never have fun again. Then she meets Liam, her cousin’s sexy roommate. Hooking up with a hot British dude seems like the perfect way to start off the school year, but the more time she spends with him, the more she finds herself actually liking the guy. Which totally screws up her plans to live life with no regrets… MOVING ON After a year with her dying aunt, Bette knows what she wants from life. 1. Keep Aunt Missy’s House 2. Get Her Dream Job 3. Never Compromise Chris Pressley is the perfect roommate—uptight and damaged and hung up on his ex. And hot. Bette doesn’t date, but she definitely likes looking. Chris just needs to get away from the happiest couple on campus: the sweet, shy girl he loves and his former best friend. Watching Bette rock her tattoos and her curves even as she builds her own business is an education. That’s probably why he can’t keep his mind off her… Bette isn’t interested in changing for anyone. But the heat rising between her and Chris won’t leave her the same… LETTING GO Some people like a little chaos. Not Sarah. Growing up in a house of humiliating filth means she has three crystal-clear goals: 1. Get through college, however she can. 2. Keep her four-year-old sister away from her mom’s hoarding. 3. Never, never let disorder take over her life. Of course, studying, working, and taking care of a toddler mean Sarah has no time for fun. Until she meets Zac. He’s sweet, he’s funny, they have compatible plans for the zombie apocalypse. But Sarah can’t let him in. It’s not just his three drooly, sloppy dogs—with him in her life, the pristine future she’s working for would be shredded before you can say Down, boy! Sometimes falling in love is really all about letting go. \"An absorbing coming-of-age journey full of first love and first heart break.\" -USA Today BestsellingAuthor, K. A. Tucker ***Originally published in 2015 with different covers.",

Having spent his college years and early twenties faithful to his sweetheart who ultimately dumped him for his brother, Jesse Kirby will never again be anyone’s fool. He’s been making up for lost time by sampling every woman he missed out on. But as thirty approaches, the revolving door to his bedroom isn’t doing it for him anymore. When he meets the altruistic Cassidy Anderson, he realizes it’s time to make some meaning out of his life. Sure, she may only be interested in him for his body and his literary tattoos, but he will make her see him for the man he now knows he can be. Cassidy Anderson has always lived her life to serve others and dated stable men her own age or older with the same goals in mind. As she considers an offer from one of those stable men, twenty-nine-year-old bartender Jesse Kirby sets his sights on her, giving her options she doesn’t need to consider. It’s been so long since Cassidy has experienced a body and a libido like his that she isn’t sure if she can pass him up. But just for a taste, because a relationship like theirs could only be headed for heartbreak. Grayton Beach Dreams is book five in the Love Along Highway 30A series, which features beautiful beach communities, a circle of unique and amazing friends, and romances that will have you cheering on the couples and fanning yourself from the heat. All books are standalone and can be enjoyed in or out of order.",

        "description": "Four emotionally driven new adult romance novels from award-winning author, Kate L. Mary. Full of self-discovery, romance, and angst, follow four couples as they navigate first love, heartbreak, and learn to put the past behind them. THE LIST The List. Twenty things every girl must do before she turns twenty... Body Piercing Get Drunk First Kiss But thanks to her crazy, over-protective father, Annie Roth is way behind schedule. Good thing it's her first semester of college, because Annie is more than ready to start checking off items... Fake ID Skinny Dipping Road Trip!!! Where it gets complicated? Ryan and Chris. Best friends. Both sweet, funny, totally hot, and totally into Annie.But there are some things on The List that Annie only wants to do with Ryan... Lose it Get heart broken Fall in love NO REGRETS College is supposed to be fun. Go to parties. Pick up guys. Maybe get in a little trouble. On the surface Cami is your average, wild teenager out to have a good time, but inside she’s struggling. Almost a year ago her best friend was in a car accident, an accident Cami feels responsible for. Since then, she’s made it her personal mission to experience everything life has to offer, both for herself and for Julie, who will never have fun again. Then she meets Liam, her cousin’s sexy roommate. Hooking up with a hot British dude seems like the perfect way to start off the school year, but the more time she spends with him, the more she finds herself actually liking the guy. Which totally screws up her plans to live life with no regrets… MOVING ON After a year with her dying aunt, Bette knows what she wants from life. 1. Keep Aunt Missy’s House 2. Get Her Dream Job 3. Never Compromise Chris Pressley is the perfect roommate—uptight and damaged and hung up on his ex. And hot. Bette doesn’t date, but she definitely likes looking. Chris just needs to get away from the happiest couple on campus: the sweet, shy girl he loves and his former best friend. Watching Bette rock her tattoos and her curves even as she builds her own business is an education. That’s probably why he can’t keep his mind off her… Bette isn’t interested in changing for anyone. But the heat rising between her and Chris won’t leave her the same… LETTING GO Some people like a little chaos. Not Sarah. Growing up in a house of humiliating filth means she has three crystal-clear goals: 1. Get through college, however she can. 2. Keep her four-year-old sister away from her mom’s hoarding. 3. Never, never let disorder take over her life. Of course, studying, working, and taking care of a toddler mean Sarah has no time for fun. Until she meets Zac. He’s sweet, he’s funny, they have compatible plans for the zombie apocalypse. But Sarah can’t let him in. It’s not just his three drooly, sloppy dogs—with him in her life, the pristine future she’s working for would be shredded before you can say Down, boy! Sometimes falling in love is really all about letting go. \"An absorbing coming-of-age journey full of first love and first heart break.\" -USA Today BestsellingAuthor, K. A. Tucker ***Originally published in 2015 with different covers.",

        "description": "Being with him would be too reckless. But maybe just this once... Having spent his college years and early twenties faithful to his sweetheart who ultimately dumped him for his brother, Jesse Kirby will never again be anyone’s fool. He’s been making up for lost time by sampling every woman he missed out on. But as thirty approaches, the revolving door to his bedroom isn’t doing it for him anymore. When he meets the altruistic Cassidy Anderson, he realizes it’s time to make some meaning out of his life. Sure, she may only be interested in him for his body and his literary tattoos, but he will make her see him for the man he now knows he can be. Cassidy Anderson has always lived her life to serve others and dated stable men her own age or older with the same goals in mind. As she considers an offer from one of those stable men, twenty-nine-year-old bartender Jesse Kirby sets his sights on her, giving her options she doesn’t need to consider. It’s been so long since Cassidy has experienced a body and a libido like his that she isn’t sure if she can pass him up. But just for a taste, because a relationship like theirs could only be headed for heartbreak. Grayton Beach Dreams is book five in the Love Along Highway 30A series, which features beautiful beach communities, a circle of unique and amazing friends, and romances that will have you cheering on the couples and fanning yourself from the heat. All books are standalone and can be enjoyed in or out of order.",

        "description": "Since its foundation in 1951, the French film journal Cahiers du Cin- perhaps, the most influential and probably the most interesting film journal ever published - has been a major source of ideas and controversy within film criticism and film-making. The fourth volume in this influential series of anthologies covers the vibrant and turbulent period from 1973 to 1978, in which the editorial make-up and policy of the journal changed radically, and issues of theory, history and politics dominated critical debate. The anthology combines essays by critics such as Pascal Bonitzer, Serge Daney and These Giraud; round-table discussions; reviews of contemporary films from Star Warsand King Kongto Padre Padroneand Jeanne Dielman; and interviews with leading theorists including Marc Ferro and Michel Foucault, presenting a rich sampler of Cahiers' provocative and indispensable contribution to debates in film and cultural politics.",

        "description": "★★★★★ They say... \"Once bitten by the rodeo bug, you never quite get rid of it,\" but one note is about to change everything for Caitlyn... After her father, a well-known bull rider died in a horrible accident, She gave up on barrel racing in the rodeo circuit. Now, she is trying to put her life back together pursuing a nursing degree to forget her past life. But as a horse lover, she still makes time at the vast 10,000 acres estate of Ruth Ann Whitehead carrying out a children’s training session for several community children barrel racing once a week. Sam Hayden is the son of Army Hayden, who was a lifetime friend of Ames. The families go way back, and even after the death of her father, Sam and Army check in whenever they are in Sage, Wyoming. Sam has long had a thing for Caitlyn, but she is focused on moving away from this life and starting over someplace that doesn’t remind her of all her loss. Her momma had left her with Ames years ago, headed back to civilization herself, and Sam couldn’t risk loving someone that was always looking to move on – or at least he tried not to. One note is about to change everything, though – when Caitlyn’s sincere secret wish is fulfilled, and her dreams of the future take shape once again, she will be left with one important choice to make, will she make the right one?

        "description": "These Bear Shifter country music stars are about to meet the women they never knew they needed! Contains the following novels: Matthew: Melinda Darling has always dreamed of being at the center of the Nashville country music scene. She thought getting her Master's Degree in Music Business would be her ticket to the top, but it turns out managers are a dime a dozen in Music City. With no other prospects and student loan repayments on the horizon, she takes an internship position under the devious Kitty Konstantine. The job was simple: find talent, introduce talent to Konstantine Talent Agency, and keep it all professional. When she finds The 4 Saints, she can see the men ooze with talent, their stage presence commanding rapt attention. When she lays eyes on Matt Saint, she knows she has no hope of keeping it professional... Matthew Saint has a lot on his shoulders, and he's got the scars to prove it. As guitarist for The 4 Saints, he and his brothers have to live in two worlds. On the one hand, they're up and coming country music stars just trying to make it in Nashville. On the other hand, they're a clan of Bear Shifters that have to be careful who they let get close. Trouble is never far off, and since meeting Mel Darlin', he thinks maybe he's due for a little more trouble in his life. Mark: Adelaide- Spencer has always had a natural talent for songwriting. She find herself humming a tune, then running around the house like a chicken with it's head cut off looking for a pen and scrap of paper. Receipts, index cards and magazines: nothing was safe from her scribbles. But these were songs she wrote for herself, not for anyone else. So when her Grandma sent her song to the Konstantine Talent Agency without her knowledge, Addison flipped her lid. Would these strangers even accept her, given her family secret? Mark Saint knows talent when he sees it. His Grandfather used to say \"There ain't no fakin' talent,\". On stage he plays the same bass fiddle his grandfather did and is always looking for the best songs for he and his brothers to record. So he drove across the state to the dilapidated house in the middle of nowhere to meet the woman who wrote this special song. When he first laid eyes on her, he knew she'd be his mate. Luke: Candace Chance was having the worst night of her life. Of course, with a name like that, did she ever have a shot? Yet another thing she could thank her mother for, but at this point she had other things on her mind. Like the freezing cold rain, the soggy cardboard that separated her from the alley asphalt. Oh, and the gangsters who are out hunting her, because she's someone else's property. Thanks again, Mom. Luke Saint knows how to move among people. As drummer in The Four Saints, he isn't quite in the spotlight that his brother Matthew is. Sometimes that can be annoying, but sometimes being unseen has it's advantages. Coming up on these thugs beating this poor helpless woman was one of those times. He tasted sour copper in his mouth and let out a roar as he charged the men. Then their world got turned upside down. John:Meg Baker wanted for nothing growing up. The best schools: she attended them. The best instructors: she learned from them. The best talents as a violinist: she was born with them. A pampered life of chauffeurs and private jets. So why was she now on the run, trying to hide herself in the one place she knew her father would never look for her? John might have the last name of Saint, but his family swears he made a deal with the Devil. Not one person from Ozarks to the Appalachias could strum a mandolin like him. And while he loved the harmonies he helped his family achieve on stage, he always felt something was missing inside. Until that night she came into The Fiddler's Cave, and for the first time in his life he thought there might be someone who felt like he did. Bartholomew:Kitty Konstantine is used to being called names. Cut throat. Demon. Bitch. But the title that always trips her up is \"daughter.\" No matter what she achieved, her father was always ready to cut her down. Even now that she's signed The Four Saints, it's still not good enough. Now, if she can't get them signed under a tighter contract, she'll lose everything. Bart Saint was pure swagger. He had that level of arrogance that couldn't be earned, so only the very few could pull it off. Tall? Sure. Handsome? Oh yeah. But it was something else that made heads turn when he walked into a room. He knew exactly who he was, and that made him invincible. He was manager to his nephews, and he'd be damned if he let Kitty Konstantine put the squeeze to them. Let the battle of wills begin. May the most stubborn negotiator win. USA Today Bestselling Author Becca Fanning brings you a Shifter Romance novella box set packed full of action, intrigue and steam! Fated Mates have never been so right and wrong for each other!",

When her father dies suddenly, she is called back from her Royal Navy post to assume the crown. While the people acclaim their new Queen, Great Britain’s first openly gay monarch, all George feels is the isolation of her station. Beatrice Elliot’s staunch anti-monarchist views have always been a point of gentle contention with her working class, royalty-loving parents. When Bea—director of a hospice charity—must spend six months working with Queen Georgina, her charity’s new patron, sparks fly and passion blooms. But is love enough to bridge the gap between Bethnal Green and Buckingham Palace?",

When she finds out she’s the illegitimate daughter of an English aristocrat, the world opens up to near-unlimited possibilities. The only problem is that her father wants her to give up the music and find a husband. Alexander, the Marquess of Hartforde, has little to no interest in remarriage, though he does find the young Miss Rowland intriguing. As he considers his options, Alexander acts as a patron to a promising American musician, Ian Rowland. Little does he know, Ian is none other than Isobel in disguise! Can Isobel keep up her charade as she develops feelings for the Marquess? What will Alexander do when he finds out the truth? It’s time to face the music. Passion’s Song is the debut Georgian romance novel of author Carolyn Jewel. If you like mistaken identity plots, strong female heroines, and laugh-out-loud moments, then you’ll love a story that will be music to your ears. Buy Passion’s Song to read the melodious tale of love today! Passion’s Song was originally published in 1987 and is the first book I wrote. Other than correcting typographical errors in the original, this book stands as I wrote it in 1987. The back cover copy of the original book referred to a devilish duke, even though there was no duke in the story. I have refrained from the temptation to add one.",

Persia has dedicated her life to saving the planet from greedy construction companies, even if that meant she lost out on a life filled with laughter, love, and passion. Considering she's generally surrounded by losers, potheads, and slackers, it's not such a big loss. Then she meets Warren--a tall, muscular hunk of hottie she wants to climb like the trees she's trying to save. Werewolf Warren Edgecomb lost out on love once and never imagined he'd find a woman for him. Then he stumbles across Persia and he knows the gorgeous female is *his*. Every curvaceous, delicious, tempting inch of her. The only problem? She's human and can't sense their shifter mate-bond. Plus there's the fact that she likes his wolf better than him. Warren's only chance of winning over the delectable Persia is to join her protest. Since they both want to bring down the developer attempting to steal his pack's lands, it seems like a match made in heaven. Until he learns a secret that rocks his faith in his instincts--and in Persia.",

With little recourse, the rival religious groups, the church of Iron and chapel of steam, do the unthinkable and hire a firm of necromancers to track their missing diety. Enter Emma Elric, apprentice to Lyceum, and new-hire to Abelworth, Cain, and Lyceum. Eager to impress her boss, Emma will do whatever it takes, including selling parts of what make her up. Goh Si-Woo and Caitlyn Alderberry had devoted themselves to Iaralie. As the first to notice their God's disappearance, their anxiety has them working together, despite how bad it looks, to save the one thing that's given their lives meaning. The deeper they dig, the more their world changes, and the more they are forced to reexamine their beliefs. Third Heaven's Throne is about belief, how the stories we're told shape the world, and what happens when powerful people control those stories. It is full of flesh and bones, misery, anxiety, terrible jokes, and queer love.",

When I walked away from Sam to be with Trevor it was so I could have the future I'd always wanted. But I soon found out life with Trevor wasn't what I dreamed and it all fell apart. I fled to California and now I'm trying to live a new life, running a vintage shop and missing Sam. When I found out he was playing a show nearby, I couldn't resist seeing him again. I hope we can start over, but I'm worried. It's been years and he hasn't reached out to me since I turned him down. And if we do discover each other again, will I be able to handle the truth about the years we spent apart? Sam Rae refusing to come with me was hard to get over, but I didn't have a choice. I had to keep going. I tried to live my life and find someone new, but I couldn't love anyone like I love Rae. It left me with a son, but still no partner. When I see Rae again, I have no question in my mind we are supposed to be together. But my career hasn't changed. And I wonder if she'll be willing to try again when she finds out it's not just about me anymore.

        "description": "Book 1 Bestselling author, Lexy Timms, brings you a firehouse romance so hot, it's sizzling! To Rebecca Taylor, her job had become simple. Sort of like lather, rinse, repeat. She travels throughout the country certifying fire station equipment. She’s a fully certified fire fighter, but her area of expertise is in testing out new equipment that will save lives. She lands up at Station 5 in Phoenix, AZ, the one place she’s been trying to avoid. She grew up just outside the city, along with the newly hired sexy lieutenant, Sam Evans. He was best friend’s with Becca’s brother, before he died in a random fire almost a decade earlier. Heat runs ramped in the city of Phoenix—desert sun, burning buildings, and the undeniable hot attraction between Becca and Sam. When the past begins to appear in familiar fire patterns, Becca is startled to realize there may be an arsonist in the city. Her brother, Corey’s death had been ruled an accident. Will she be able to prove it was murder before the arsonist comes looking for her? Book 2 Back at Station 5 in Phoenix, Arizona, Becca Taylor is struggling to come to terms with the possibility that her brother’s death about a decade ago was through the hands of an arsonist. With her brother’s high school friend, Sam Evans, the two of them try to dig up evidence to prove it. The sexy fire lieutenant friend-with-benefits is determined to help Becca and keep her safe. With flames running in every direction, Becca zero’s in on who she believes is responsible. With a twist no one will see coming, Becca ‘s determination to find the truth might just be the one thing that puts her right in the line of fire. Book 3 Lieutenant firefighter Sam Evans refuses to believe his Chief, and everyone else’s, belief that the girl he’s fallen for has been murdered. When all the evidence seems to prove she’s been killed by the arsonist, Sam stands firm in his belief that she’s alive. Proving it is the challenge he’s up against and will risk his job, his life—everything to verify it. Becca Taylor didn’t think life could be anymore challenging after she lost her brother. Now she’s in a fight for her life and she will do whatever it takes to survive.

        "description": "I swear I am not the kind of person who gets her cell phone caught in places that require an ER trip and an OBGYN. But, apparently, I am. I’m also not the kind of person who spends all her time thinking about the guy who got away. But, apparently, I am, too. Starting a new life in Boston isn’t supposed to include repeatedly embarrassing myself in public, meeting a crazy blond woman who has ties to the band Random Acts of Crazy, and definitely isn’t supposed to include wallowing in a past I thought I’d left behind four years ago. But, apparently, it does. And the drummer for the band, Sam Hinton, is the boy I loved in high school and who disappeared with my heart. Now he’s back, better than ever. Second chances aren’t supposed to make scars disappear and hearts mend. But, apparently, they can. If you trust enough. Fate took their lives by storm four years ago and put an unbreachable gulf between Sam and Amy. Can time really heal all wounds…or are some scars too deep? The second book in the Random series after the wildly successful New York Times and USA Today bestseller Random Acts of Crazy, Random Acts of Trust is a romantic comedy that explores the love between one man, one woman, and ends with one Happily Ever After (and no cliffhangers or chickens!). And you’ll never look at a cell phone the same way again. Listen to the audiobook, narrated by Sebastian York and Andi Arndt!! Topics: contemporary romance, romantic comedy, new adult romance, rockstar romance, rock star romance, erotic romance, seductive story, hot romance, women's fiction, women's romance, bbw romance, romance, contemporary woman julia kent, julia kent romance",

Dmitri Avalon was a savant on the floor and an animal in bed. As one of the top male escorts in the mean streets of Chicago, Dmitri lived life on his terms. Sex was his business, and personal attachments had no place in business. He wasn’t a companion; he wasn’t a friend and he sure as hell held no attachment to any of the men he serviced. However, when a new client Alexander Hamilton, Sin City’s newest unapologetic gay multimillionaire, pushes him out of his comfort zone, Dmitri finds himself floundering. This new road called love, what was it? Was it worth it? Could he leave his fast and loose life where, one where he had a carefree life, and insane money, but on the other, the one with Alex he had stability, a new lease on life and the assurance of a good lover? Was he going to follow his heart or stick to what he knew?",

Until the guy in the red hoodie. Just a glance, and I was owned. Enslaved. What’s worst? He didn’t even notice me. Yep. You guessed right: I’m delusional. I’m obsessed. I’m a stalker. A martyr. A masochist. I’ve allowed my obsession to lead me down into a deep, dark pit, selfishly hurting everyone around me, and only his requited love can pull me out of it. But I won’t apologize for it. I won’t apologize for being in love with Jahleel Kingston. I’ve loved him at first sight. I’ve loved him for five empty years. I’ve loved him through all his bullcrap and asshole-isms. I love him even now. My name is Saskia Day. I’m British. I’m famous. I’m stinking rich. And this is my pathetic story. Read at your own bloody risk.

I like it rough and preferably with strangers, and I sure as hell don’t do love. Ever since my buddy introduced me to the kooky pet wedding photographer, I’ve done my best to ignore her. But Mia won’t take no for an answer. Now she’s all I think about. Mia One glimpse of South’s photo and it’s a serious case of insta-lust. Then I meet him in the flesh, and all bets are off. I’m determined to make the blue-eyed rocker mine. At least for a night or two. Who knew he’d want so much more? But I know for a fact he won’t want this—my sweet, tiny little secret. How can I keep them both—the rock star and his baby—when a 'watcher' in the shadows is determined to make sure I don't? A will-they-won’t-they roller coaster ride makes the HEA extra-sweet. Full length standalone. Contains strong language and steamy scenes. Keywords: steamy romance, steamy contemporary, musician hero, rockstar, rockstars, rock star romance, new adult romance, rockstar romance, rock star romance, coming of age romance, seductive story, hot romance, free first book in series",

        "description": "'Make a Joyful Noise' (Book 1 in the 'Sing with the Choir' series), is the sparkling tale of a choir preparing for a very special Christmas performance of \"Belshazzar's Feast.\" We meet a host of characters who are mercilessly sent up by the author: Lucy the staggeringly trusting young music teacher, Tristan the lecherous and vain anti-hero, Miss Greymitt the ageing and slightly confused choir pianist, Claire the shameless and scheming temptress, and singers with nothing but resonance between their ears. Just as all does not run smoothly for King Belshazzar and the inhabitants of Babylon in Walton's music, so the characters in the novel suffer from hopeless yearnings, romantic misunderstandings and the unfortunate consequences of their own misguided actions. All is sharply and wittily observed in a delightful mix of romance, music and humour. The second book in the 'Sing with the Choir' series, 'The Funny Business of Life', is now available from all Amazon sites. The opening scene is set in 2014, eleven years after the end of 'Make a Joyful Noise'. Both books can be read as standalone titles.",

        "description": "Enjoy this sweet rockstar contemporary romance from bestselling author Michelle MacQueen Piper Hayes’ world shattered the day her parents died. Suddenly she and her older sister were on their own with only each other to rely on. Taken in by their mother’s best friend, she had to navigate a new home, living with two strange boys who’d come to mean more to her than anything. She’s survived on pure stubbornness and songwriting. Now it’s years later and she’s famous, but the world doesn’t know it. Her song, Fate, blares over airwaves, showcasing the soulful voices of her sister and Ben, the boy she’s grown up with. They’re music’s golden couple, and Piper is their… assistant. Also the secret mind behind everything her sister claims to write. When the golden couple crumbles, Piper is there to pick up the pieces. But which broken heart will she put back together? And if Ben finds out Piper wrote the words that made him fall in love with her sister, will he ever forgive her? Who is she kidding? World famous rock stars don’t choose average girls like her. Lose yourself in a swoony, sweet romance. Love is a Lyric is book one in Rockstars Anonymous, featuring one rock star support group, five ridiculous stars, and four swoony romances. Beware of concert crashers, meddling families, and rock stars who can’t seem to stay out of each other’s love lives. Each book in the Rockstars Anonymous series is a sweet, full-length novel with a guaranteed happy ending. Rockstars Anonymous is a terrific concept—who would have thought these celebrities’ lives were anything less than perfect? There are several subplots and at least three other romances happening all at the same time, which keeps the story interesting and the reader wondering what will happen next, and to whom? One thing that is very clear is how much the characters care about each other. -- Publisher's Weekly, Booklife",

        "description": "In a controversial first novel that took the French literary world by storm and won the Prix de Flore, Tristan Garcia uses sex, friendships, and love affairs to show what happens to people when political ideals—Marxism, gay rights, sexual liberation, nationalism—come to an end. As Elizabeth Levallois, a cultural journalist, looks back on this decade and on the ravages of the AIDS epidemic in Paris, a drama unfolds—one in which love turns to hate and fidelity turns to betrayal, in both affairs of the heart and politics. With great verve and ingenuity, Garcia lays claim to an era that promised freedom as never before, and he paints an indelible, sharp, but sympathetic portrait of intellectuals lost in the age of MTV.",

        "description": "How much trouble does it take to forget your summer fling is now your English teacher? A lot. That’s right, Wylder Anderson, troublemaker extraordinaire, didn’t see this one coming. When she walks into class the first day of her senior year, Wylder’s ex is just a fond memory. Until she sees him. Sebastian Cook. Dating a teacher is so not on Wylder’s agenda for the year. Vowing to keep her distance and focus on school, she jumps headfirst into a music project with Logan—the twin brother of Wylder’s superstar nemesis—and also the younger brother of Sebastian. Yeah, that Sebastian. The Cook brothers are going to be the death of her. But they have a secret. A dangerous truth they’re hiding from the world that could burn their carefully constructed music empire to the ground. Is Wylder the spark that will ignite that fire? Or is she the solution? And is Logan Cook just an average high schooler, trying to make it to graduation? Or is he a secret rockstar, eager to disappear from the spotlight that was never meant to be his? One ex-boyfriend/teacher. One jerky superstar rocker. And a boy who is anything but what he seems. Who are these brothers? And why can’t Wylder stay away from them? Disclaimer: This is not a story of a student-teacher romance, and Wylder is not underage. Wylder and the Secret Rockstar is book one in Reluctant Rockstars, a clean YA romance series. This book is NOT a standalone. If you like feisty women, enemies to lovers, and scandals in the world of music then this book is for you.",

After years of recording commercials, Josie Tibbs longs to get back into the music industry. But the sound recording engineer had traveled that road once before and crawled back home with a broken heart. Wary of any man in the music business, she longs for a steady man and a great recording career. Brock Gentry lived for the music and so became an extraordinarily talented country singer. On the fringes of success, he's ready to take his chance and go on the road to Nashville. But he and the recording company clash over his image among other things. Hoping to find the right sound mixer he seeks out Josie Tibbs after hearing of her work with another country singer who's hit the big time. Although she wants nothing to do with him romantically, he wins her over professionally and she decides to come on the road with his band. Together they blaze a trail to Nashville, her cat in tow, in the close quarters of life on the bus with the rest of the band. Despite the obstacles of life on the road, Brock and Josie find they can't keep their feelings from each other. But Josie's been through this before and knows the dogs of the music industry can bite hard. As they make it closer to Nashville, she fears a chance at success could spell the end of their love.",

Billionaire Calder Cunningham has a secret. He’s also willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants—and right now, he wants Lily Frazer.

But that handyman—Ward Brannon—turns out to be a lot more than she bargained for. In spite of herself, she can’t stay away from him, even when their fiery affair puts her darkest secrets—and her heart—at risk. Who knew one wicked family could cause so much delicious trouble?

He's from the right side of the tracks and I always knew he was going somewhere, so I want to hang on for the ride. But if I'm going to impress an experienced, wealthy guy and convince him I'm a keeper, I need to be more confident, and definitely not a virgin. That's when I turn to Sam. My best friend for as long as I can remember, Sam has always been there for me, and I hope he will again. One night with him and I'll be ready for Trevor. Only, when that one night is over, I'm not sure about my plan anymore. Trevor I've loved Rae since the day I met her, I just never told her. We've been by each other's sides through everything and watched as each other struggled to find our way in our hometown. I can't blame her for wanting more. But I hate to see her with that guy. He's everything I've always hated about the rich guys from high school and now he's got his hands on Rae. Our arrangement seems like the perfect opportunity, until I realize I might not only lose the love of my life, but my best friend also.

Assistant Commonwealth Attorney CAROL MABRY heads up an investigation into a string of stranglings in Virginia's capital. The serial killer known as Richmond Red remorselessly snuffs out beautiful young women with violin strings before ritually enshrining their lovely lifeless bodies inside a pentagram of blood red candles. Country music superstar BOBBY KENT makes an unscheduled return trip to his Virginia home for the first time in years. To his shock, he discovers that he and Carol have a young daughter, Lisa. His parents have kept Lisa hidden from him her entire life while simultaneously deceiving Carol about Bobby's interest in fatherhood. Angry and hurt over the deception, Carol and Bobby strive to cope with this newly discovered reality. They struggle to overcome harmful secrets and years of lies to decide whether they have a future. Neither of them realize how every waking moment they move closer to the serial killer who harbors an unnatural and deadly obsession. With the beautiful Carol locked in Richmond Red's sights, the clock is ticking down to her destruction. Will the two find love, or is their sonata striking a dangerous final chord? ******************** bridgeman, christian, christian drama, christian family drama, christian fiction, christian love story, christian mystery, christian romance, christian romantic mystery, christian romantic suspense, christian romantic thriller, christian suspense, christian thriller, contemporary, contemporary christian, contemporary christian fiction, contemporary christian romance, contemporary christian suspense, contemporary drama, contemporary inspirational fiction, contemporary inspirational romance, contemporary inspirational suspense, contemporary love story, contemporary suspense, drama, dramatic christian, dramatic christian fiction, dramatic christian romance, dramatic christian suspense, dramatic inspirational fiction, dramatic inspirational romance, dramatic inspirational suspense, dramatic love story, dramatic suspense, edgy christian fiction, edgy christian romance, edgy inspirational fiction, edgy inspirational romance, fiction, God, hailey bridgeman, haley bridgeman, halle bridgeman, hallee bridgeman, Holy Spirit, inspirational, inspirational christian fiction, inspirational fiction, inspirational romance, inspirational suspense, Jesus, love, love story, olivia kimbrell press, romance, romantic christian, romantic christian fiction, romantic christian romance, romantic christian suspense, romantic drama, romantic inspirational fiction, romantic inspirational suspense, romantic inspirational thriller, romantic love story, romantic suspense, romantic themes, suspenseful drama, traditional love story, traditional romance, traditional suspense, serial killer, Richmond virginia, stalker, split personality, psychotic killer, district attorney, prosecutor, country music superstar, country music star, country music singer, secret baby, betrayal, college romance, unexpected consequences, protector, lover, loving man, surprise baby, surprise family, instant family, forgiveness, redemption, friendship, danger",

Now, her grown children have moved out and her daughters are pushing her to brave the perils of internet dating. Even Cari is forced to admit that her life might be a little too placid. Until, that is, a tree falls across her roof... Ray Davis always stops by What's Perkin' for his morning muffin, but the handsome master carpenter is starting to wonder if he'll ever find the chance to persuade Cari to see him as more than merely a neighbor. Consulting with her about rebuilding her damaged house gives him an excuse to spend more time with her, but she still only seems interested in him as a buddy. Then Ray's past suddenly comes looking for him, and he realizes that his dreams-or even his life-could be lost.",

        "description": "The days are hot and the nights even steamier when the sexy ranchers in this value-priced collection kick off their boots and fall in love. What the Gambler Risks: Twenty-something ice queen Sabrina York enjoys fame and fortune writing self-help books for women—but she could do without her reputation as the Oldest Living (Supposed) Virgin in Vegas. Jase Reeves knows Sabrina’s not nearly as cold as she’d like people to think. He didn’t intend to have a one-night stand with the Vegas Virgin, but he can’t get her out of his head. Now Sabrina has one goal: stay away from the handsome gambler before he melts her career—and her heart. A Kiss in the Morning Mist: Former US Marshal Eamon MacDermott failed to prevent his closest family’s death at the hands of the Logan gang, and the guilt made him hang up his guns and bow out of life. That is, until he runs into widow Theodosia “Theo” Danforth, who believes everyone needs kindness. When the outlaw gang sets its sights on destroying her Morning Mist ranch, Eamon must choose between a final chance to exact vengeance and forging a new future with Theo. Legacy of Lies: Garrison Taggart is in a jam. The family’s Wyoming ranch is being sabotaged and his supernatural ability to tell when someone is lying hasn’t been a lick of help. Now sweet schoolteacher Sara Lopez informs him that his son is having trouble at school, and it’s clear he needs a hand. Yet Sara’s recent breakup with Garrison’s rival puts her in an uncomfortable position, despite her attraction to her student’s father. But when the boy goes missing, Sara and Garrison must risk their deepest secrets and their lives to save him. Montana Christmas Magic: Tennis pro Logan Collins inherits a ranch in rural Phillipsburg, Montana, that he’s not allowed to sell for six months. It’s just enough time to start a sweet relationship with artist and chocolatier Julie Thompson. But despite the trappings of permanence—a dog, a horse, and a woman who brings light into his dark days—his life is still in New York. He’ll have to persuade Julie that Christmas in Manhattan is just as inspiring, before the holidays put a final wrap on their relationship. Relentless: Battling his partner, his attraction to spitfire rancher and professional barrel racer Cody Lewis, and the demons of his past, Dallas detective Remy LeBeau must take the ultimate risk to catch a serial killer terrorizing the rodeo circuit. It could cost him everything—including Cody’s life. One Last Letter: At sixteen, Evelyn Lancaster rejected ranch hand Jesse Greenwood to save her father’s struggling ranch. Now a newly wealthy Jesse has returned home, and he’s drawn to the land he swore to never step foot on again. As long-held emotions rekindle, he can only admit his true feelings via unsigned letters left on Evelyn’s porch … until another man comes forward to claim the correspondence as his own. Will one final note give them the courage to say yes to love on the wild Texas plains? Killing Casanova: In the small ranch community of Lindley, Nevada, Jake Caswell has a reputation as a womanizer—that is, until he meets Cassie Taylor, a blind woman who is oblivious to his normally irresistible charms. As Jake attempts to add Cassie to his list of conquests, he unintentionally pulls her into a world of violence, old wounds, and enemies out for revenge. Will Cassie be able to uncover the man behind the mask amid the threat of peril, and find love in a tangled web of danger? Sensuality Level: Sensual",

        "description": "Move in with him while I work on his home? In my best interests, of course. What?! Skylar The first time I met Gage Williams, I didn’t like him very much. Here’s why—he shot down my design idea while I was pitching to potential clients for work on an inn. I’m an interior designer. He’s the owner of the construction company in charge of renovations. After a few heated words between us, he had the audacity to call me Miss Perky. Grr…the world needs positive people! The second time we met, I still didn’t like him. No time for an alpha male with a ’tude when I’ve got a job to do. The third time, well, that’s when things went downhill fast, so I was shocked when he informed me my next job would be on his home, and I’d be moving in with him. What?! Just because I’m currently home displaced and broke. Ah, hell. Gage Skylar is chaos personified, and I bring order to chaos. Especially when a certain Miss Perky is under the delusion that sunny optimism will save the day. Nope. It’s me. You’re welcome. This romantic comedy stands alone with a swoonworthy happy-ever-after!

        "description": "This new study of the intersection of romance novels with vocal music records a society on the cusp of modernisation, with a printing industry emerging to serve people s growing appetites for entertainment amidst their changing views of religion and the occult. No mere diversion, fiction was integral to musical culture and together both art forms reveal key intellectual currents that circulated in the early nineteenth-century British home and were shared by many consumers. Roger Hansford explores relationships between music produced in the early 1800s for domestic consumption and the fictional genre of romance, offering a new view of romanticism in British print culture. He surveys romance novels by Ann Radcliffe, Matthew Lewis, Sir Walter Scott, James Hogg, Edward Bulwer and Charles Kingsley in the period 1790-1850, interrogating the ways that music served to create mood and atmosphere, enlivened social scenes and contributed to plot developments. He explores the connections between musical scenes in romance fiction and the domestic song literature, treating both types of source and their intersection as examples of material culture. Hansford s intersectional reading revolves around a series of imaginative figures - including the minstrel, fairies, mermaids, ghosts, and witches, and Christians engaged both in virtue and vice - the identities of which remained consistent as influence passed between the art forms. While romance authors quoted song lyrics and included musical descriptions and characters, their novels recorded and modelled the performance of songs by the middle and upper classes, influencing the work of composers and the actions of performers who read romance fiction. \"",

Now, over a hundred years later, the house is being rebuilt - and so the lives of four very different people converge. Ned, a successful architect, is obsessed with restoring the house to its former glory. Focussed and determined - and bruised by a past relationship - he's not looking for distractions. But then Ellen, a documentary-maker, arrives to make a film about one of the local landmarks, leaving her boyfriend and some tough decisions temporarily behind her. But as pieces of the past start to fall into place, the restoration also brings together Jimmy and Verity, two local teenagers: one falling in love for the first time, the other an incurable romantic, determined to find her fairy-tale hero. And as their hopes and fears come together they all learn some surprising lessons about finding love in the most unlikely places ...",

Hold on to your hats, country music lovers! Today’s hits are about real-life situations and down-home people—and that’s exactly what’s waiting for you as these four couples pour their hearts and souls in love’s spotlight. Forgiving Jackson: When a devastating fire at one of his concerts reopens old wounds for country superstar Jackson Beauford, he heads home for some peace and quiet—only to discover that stubborn Southern magnolia Emory Lowell has planted herself at his family estate, bringing chaos in her wake. Kiss Me, Katie: When aspiring fiddler Katie McCoy joins handsome singer Blake Jackson on his sold-out Country Summer Nights tour, they are a match made in music heaven. She’s focused on sending her band to the top of the charts; he’s been around enough to understand that celebrity attracts the wrong kind of lovers. But will fame destroy their love? Drive Me Sane: Sera Cavins returns to her hometown after a stint in Afghanistan, hoping some time alone will help her find her way back to being the girl everyone once knew. That is, until she finds herself sharing a house with the man who left her heartbroken before her deployment. Tyler Creech made it to Nashville and even earned a number one hit, but he’s back in Cobb City, Kentucky, to ease the stress of his next release. Can they accept that sometimes going a little crazy is what keeps you sane? His Temporary Wife: Esmerelda Salinas thought she was content to sing country karaoke in her aunt’s bar until sexy Rafael Benton offered her $250,000 to marry him for the summer. Even though rumors run rampant about Rafael, Esme knows she would enjoy the benefits without the “I do”…but sleeping with a man for the thrill is one thing. Can she accept a job that would make her rich but might destroy all she holds sacred? Sensuality Level: Sensual",

        "description": "Don't let fear sway you. You're not your past. Seraphina Daniels feels like running--the kind of running that doesn't include a set destination. So, when her childhood friend calls in distress, she's more than prepared to leave behind her failed--and famous--relationship, her writer's block, and her impending thirtieth birthday. But upon her return to the Ozarks--a sharp contrast to New York City--she discovers that everything's changed. I think I wanted you before I even knew what it was like to want someone. The homecoming brings Sera to Chace Holloway: the man who's made a home out of the place that was once hers. Romance isn't an option, but friendship comes easily with the twenty-two-year-old songwriter--despite the attraction they both feel. He is music, and I am merely madness and melancholy. What started as an escape becomes more of a trap when the past begins to wrap around the present. As hope blooms, Sera and Chace face their biggest obstacles--what they each fear, and what old lovers desire. Burning Muses is Book 1 of the Muse & Music Series. It can be read as a standalone.",

Within this battle of Love, every human being has a part. Eden Buckley is about to find hers....... A Modern and Heart-warming Ecology Romance about two single parent families and second-chance love set in Harlan County, Kentucky featuring country music band Ward Thomas. Review 5 stars; To generate that level of emotion in a reader in respect of a fictional character is a brilliant achievement on the part of the author Review 5 stars; An entertaining read which I highly recommend if you want a charming romance that is a little bit different. Eden Buckley is a gutsy, capricious and brogue speaking Harlan county school teacher with a temper as stubborn as a superpower but an honest heart of gold. Just divorced from her ex- teenage sweetheart and coming to terms with being a single parent, raising her partially invalid son Jamie. Until today, she'd only had to wage a battle against her alcoholic and abusive husband Kyle. Now, she has a bigger focus for all of her caustic and vicarious energies................. Fighting for the rights of the local community of young and elderly Harlan folk to stop the machiavellian and insidious Tennessee construction company boss Langdon Stanley Dainty or Mr Acid from wreaking total havoc and demolishing their houses to build a link road to the 1-75 highway, promised by the government for over twenty years. In the fight to save the houses, Eden's fastidious path accidentally crosses with World ecologist and widower James Ustinov from England. A thoroughly driven man who believes he has to reach his goal sooner than later, before it's all too late. What Eden and James believe to be the good and right, brings them together as one. Alone they are just one voice. Together they are Saving Eden. Ward Thomas country music band appear courtesy of themselves (Catherine & Lizzy) and Ward Thomas Music.

        "description": "On a fine spring evening, the young Spanish Count Cesara came, with his companions, Schoppe and Dian, to Sesto, in order the next morning to cross over to the Borrom¾an island, Isola Bella, in Lago Maggiore. The proudly blooming youth glowed with the excitement of travelling, and with thoughts of the coming morrow, when he should see the isle, that gayly decorated throne of Spring, and on it a man who had been promised him for twenty years. This twofold glow exalted my picturesque hero to the form of an angry god of the Muses. His beauty made a more triumphal entry into Italian eyes than into the narrow Northern ones from the midst of which he had come; in Milan many had wished he were of marble, and stood with elder gods of stone, either in the Farnese Palace or in the Clementine Museum, or in the Villa of Albani; nay, had not the Bishop of Novara, with his sword at his side, a few hours before, asked Schoppe (riding behind) who he was? And had not the latter, with a droll squaring of the wrinkle-circle round his lips, made this copious answer (by way of enlightening his spiritual lordship): \"It's my Telemachus, and I am the Mentor. I am the milling-machine and the die which coins him,Ñthe wolf's tooth and flattening mill which polishes him down,Ñthe man, in short, that regulates him\"? The glowing form of the youthful Cesara was still more ennobled by the earnestness of an eye always buried in the future, and of a firmly shut, manly mouth, and by the daring decision of young, fresh faculties; he seemed as yet to be a burning-glass in the moonlight, or a dark precious stone of too much color, which the world, as in the case of other jewels, can brighten and improve only by cutting hollow. As he drew nearer and nearer, the island attracted him, as one world does another, more and more intensely. His internal restlessness rose as the outward tranquillity deepened. Beside all this, Dian, a Greek by birth and an artist, who had often circumnavigated and sketched Isola Bella and Isola Madre, brought these obelisks of Nature still nearer to his soul in glowing pictures; and Schoppe often spoke of the great man whom the youth was to see to-morrow for the first time. As the people were carrying by, down below in the street, an old man fast asleep, into whose strongly marked face the setting sun cast fire and life, and who was, in short, a corpse borne uncovered, after the Italian custom, suddenly, in a wild and hurried tone, he asked his friends, \"Does my father look thus?\" But what impels him with such intense emotions towards the island is this: He had, on Isola Bella, with his sister, who afterward went to Spain, and by the side of his mother, who had since passed to the shadowy land, sweetly toyed and dreamed away the first three years of his life, lying in the bosom of the high flowers of Nature; the island had been, to the morning slumber of life, to his childhood's hours, a Raphael's painted sleeping-chamber. But he had retained nothing of it all in his head and heart, save in the one a deep, sadly sweet emotion at the name, and in the other the squirrel, which, as the family scutcheon of the Borrom¾ans, stands on the upper terrace of the island.",

        "description": "The story of the Gentry family continues in 3 thrilling sweet romances in the Texas Hearts series! Boxed Set 4-6 includes: GYPSY HEARTS He was a country star in the making...and he wanted her to complete him... After years of recording commercials, Josie Tibbs longs to get back into the music industry. But the sound recording engineer had traveled that road once before and crawled back home with a broken heart. Wary of any man in the music business, she longs for a steady man and a great recording career. Brock Gentry lived for the music and so became an extraordinarily talented country singer. On the fringes of success, he's ready to take his chance and go on the road to Nashville. But he and the recording company clash over his image among other things. Hoping to find the right sound mixer he seeks out Josie Tibbs after hearing of her work with another country singer who's hit the big time. Although she wants nothing to do with him romantically, he wins her over professionally and she decides to come on the road with his band. Together they blaze a trail to Nashville, her cat in tow, in the close quarters of life on the bus with the rest of the band. Despite the obstacles of life on the road, Brock and Josie find they can't keep their feelings from each other. But Josie's been through this before and knows the dogs of the music industry can bite hard. As they make it closer to Nashville, she fears a chance at success could spell the end of their love. LEAVING LIBERTY \ufeffThere's been a storm brewing in Liberty Calvert's life. But she didn't know just how strong it would be until Texas Ranger, Jackson Gentry, came to Liberty, Texas. Her already fragile life will be changed forever if he learns the truth. Her head tells her that the best thing for all of them is for Jackson to leave Liberty as soon as his investigation wraps up. But her heart is telling her this is the one cowboy she wants to spend the rest of her life loving. HIS TEXAS HEART Time was running out for Cole Rivers. He may not have been born in the United States, but Texas was the only place he'd ever called home. He had just weeks to find the proof he needed, or risk being deported. All he needed was a little help from the daughter of the local doctor who'd treated him years ago. He didn't count on Dr. RaeAnne Daniels being so difficult to work with. But despite his own troubles, and the distraction this beautiful woman became with each passing day, how could he leave her in her time of need? RaeAnne Daniels never knew why it was so important for her father to set up his medical practice on the border of Mexico instead of working in a thriving Texas city like the one she practiced in. But when her father died and left RaeAnne in charge of cleaning up his office, she found it hard to leave the border town and people she'd always resented growing up. Cole Rivers had been her father's patient and he had problems of his own. The break-ins at the clinic and the drugs being stolen were her problem. But that didn't stop her from falling for the devastatingly handsome cowboy with a heart of gold...or stop him from showing her how wonderful true love could really be. Also available in the Texas Hearts Series: Her Heart for the Asking His Heart for the Trusting The More I See Gypsy Hearts Leaving Liberty His Texas Heart The Wedding Dress Lone Star Lady Under a Texas Star Fans of Debbie Macomber and Sherryl Woods will enjoy the Texas Hearts Series.

Three men travel to Vatican City to become priests when their eyes open to a world of faith, deception, and political intrigue. Each man has dreams of transforming the world and leading the faithful through life’s journey. Kevin, Miguel, and Anthony enter a realm where faith takes a back seat to ecclesial power. Stumbling into sexual relationships, friendships explode into a romantic rollercoaster and contradict time-honoured traditions. Wrestling with the need for intimacy and the desire to serve as priests, the three friends cling to one another for solace and support. They discover that friendship is not enough to carry them through the trials as new men at the Vatican. Each must follow his own path as they try to make sense of the bizarre world into which they have been thrust. Tarnished, three young seminarians emerge from their journeys to face the truth of love and loss as they put their lives back together. With hope and determination, they reimagine their futures as they follow their hearts. New Men: Bonds of Brotherhood is a romantic journey of self-discovery inspired by true stories. Journey with them as they explore what they truly desire.",

        "description": "Take Blue Fire's journey with them as they go from hot college band to world-famous rock stars! Book 1: You Really Got Me As a sizzling-hot lead singer, Slater Vaughn has no trouble raising heart rates—but his band’s been flat-lining for years. When Emmie, his bandmate’s sister, crashes with them in exchange for some free management, her industry know-how lands them a spot in the biggest music festival in Texas. But it isn’t just her business acumen that catches Slater’s attention. Emmie is sexy and warm, and—for the first time in his life—he wants more. But as irresistible as Slater is, Emmie is done with musicians. In her experience, a man can’t be a rock star and someone to trust with your heart—but Slater is determined to show her he’s both. Book 2: I Want You To Want Me A slow burn, enemies-to-lovers, rock star romance about two people who’re bad at love but want to be good for each other. Even more than wanting to be a rock star, Derek Valencia wants respect in the music industry. But right when his band hits the big-time, the guys spiral out of control, and the record label threatens to pull its support. So, when their manager hires a minder to keep them in line, Derek’s pride takes a hit. Still, he can’t refuse the help, not when he’s this close to getting everything he’s worked so hard for. And he can’t help the blazing attraction for the babysitter he’s so intent on disliking. Book 3: Take Me Home Tonight A slow burn, friends to lovers, rock star romance about a passionate woman who brings a wounded musician back to life. Calix Bourbon might seem like a free spirit, but that’s all a front. In reality he’s just trying to keep his fractured family together while working as a session musician. When Blue Fire hires him to replace their keyboardist, Calix is determined to make the most of the opportunity—but he can’t help being distracted by the band’s sexy personal chef. Book 4: More Than A Feeling A second chance, small town, rock star romance bursting with off-the-charts-chemistry and heat. \"Absolutely loved it! I finished this book last night, but I'm still smiling this morning. It's that good!\" Now that he's a rock star, Cooper Hood can't think of a single reason to ever go back to the town that painted him with the same brush as his addict mother. But right in the middle of his band’s national tour he gets a call to come home: his mom’s got a whopper of a secret to reveal. Daisy Charbonneau never thought she'd see her high school crush again. Especially after his band hit the big time. But when the talent she hired for her resort’s annual Huckleberry Festival bails on her, she’s desperate to find a replacement act--and her rock star crush is just the answer she's looking for. As they work together, a crush deepens into so much more, but who falls in love in two weeks? Especially when Cooper’s never coming back to town, and Daisy’s never going to leave it.",

        "description": "Jimmy is a guitar prodigy, with hair kept long to cover scars and a glass-eye that people say has a quiet moan. He pines for a Jewish flamenco dancer from Hollywood's El Cid. Vic is the trio's handsome, green-eyed tenor with a perfect ear, Vietnamese girlfriend and dreams of being a cop. His unpainted low-rider is the trio's gig car. Ray is their Chinese-Mexican violinist. He's been in love since childhood with the youngest of the Maravilla sisters, but he has incurable bone cancer. As Ray's death approaches, Jimmy's glass-eye becomes increasingly painful and lifelike. When they visit the aging oculist who created the eye, what he tells them sets three young mariachis in a Galaxy 500 on a vibrant, lyrical quest across L.A. with curanderos, gypsy flamencos, opera singers, rock stars, bohemian painters and unforgettable characters. In a sensual novel where lush harmonies and syncopated guitars rise from the page, Hernandez tackles issues of race, fate, poverty, and culture without dimming the joys of art and music, youth and first love.Review from Goodreads: \"Lovely novel about young mariachis finding their place in the world, soaked in a vibrant sense of place and time. Somehow captures that feeling of being twenty and seeing the world spread before you in a way I've rarely seen portrayed well.\"Review from the back cover: \"Wrapped in the sights and sounds of 1970s Los Angeles, vibrant and nostalgic, Hernandez explores the complex intersections of race, love, poverty and coming of age...and through it all we are serenaded by his lyrical descriptions of the life and music of the mariachi.\"",

Without Joey’s knowledge, her overbearing and neurotic mother submits an application for her to appear on the reality show, Married Blind. When the producers surprise her with the news that they have cast her, Joey wants nothing to do with the show but agrees to participate because, at this point in her life, she really has nothing to lose. Lights, camera, action… Welcome to another season of Married Blind. Contestants are about to take the plunge, but only one couple will come out of the house winners!",

        "description": "Summary: It is early summer in Brighton, 1839. A young woman, Miss Emily Cheston, is about to enter society the upcoming season, but first she needs to improve her musical and art talents. However, her new music teacher seems to take a passionately interest in her, and soon she finds herself utterly in love. As summer turns to autumn, Emily has a difficult choice to make… An extract from the story: “May I?” he asked and sighed in delight “Yes,” I said breathlessly, feeling slightly light-headed by his touch. My nipples were stiffening under the caress of his fingers. The kissing was good, but this was different and more intense. I helped him remove my clothes until I lay half-naked with the chemise pulled down to my waist and my day dress lay in a wrinkly heap by the base of the willow tree. Jonathan seemed to be completely lost in desire and when I let him kiss my nipples while cradling my pale breasts, he made that little soft moan again, which made me lose the last shred of control. Ridden by passion I took one of his hands and as in haze I manoeuvred it in under the layers of the chemise… Keywords: First love, suppressed desire, fairy stones, lessons, petting. About the author: Lady T. L. Jennings is a secretive writer who loves the Victorian era, afternoon tea, and small obedient dogs. She lives in Oxfordshire, England, and writes Victorian erotica and romance short stories with a dash of gothic mystique, usually after midnight and by candle light. She collects corsets, lovers, and books. Reviews: \"I loved this! Descriptive, sensual and a very pleasant read. I enjoyed it very much.\" \"...It's a lovely story...\" Rated four stars by reader's reviews.

        "description": "Ryan Stone is a less than average teenager. He doesn’t have fancy clothes. He doesn’t carry around the latest smartphone and he definitely doesn’t have an MP3 player. Instead, he goes to school, does his chores and dreams of a new life away from Brookfield where he’s expected to follow in his blue collar family’s footsteps. Hadley Carter is America’s Pop Princess. A successful recording artist living her dream with a sold-out tour and a handful of Grammy’s there isn’t much that she wants for, except love. But finding love on the road is near impossible when all she longs for are romantic dinners, a nighttime stroll on the beach and holding hands with someone who isn’t going to exploit her. When a chance encounter introduces Ryan to Hadley, will he be like her adoring fans looking for a way in, or will it be Hadley who pursues Ryan even though it might cost her the only career she’s known. Lost in You is a story about following your dreams, taking risks and getting lost in love.",

The cameras were rolling, and the audience was waiting… Joshua Wilson never thought he’d get married until the day that he met and married Joey Mitchell on the hit television show Married Blind. Joey never thought she’d find love… period, especially after her heart was broken. But now that she’s married to her celebrity crush, she’s trying to turn her fairytale into her happily ever after before the wicked witch takes a bite out of her apple. Now TV’s favorite couple is moving their love affair off camera and trying to build a life around Josh’s Hollywood career while dodging his crazy fans, producers wanting to chronicle their first year of marriage for the public and Jules Maxwell—Josh’s all too famous ex. But we all know where there’s good, there’s bad. Every relationship has its ups and downs. With the cameras no longer watching their every move, will the love they shared in the house be the same when their lives become a Twisted Reality?",

After crashing and burning in spectacular fashion during her debut tour with her band Court'n Jacks, Nadine had gone to rehab to get her...ahem...stuff in order. Now she was ready to try again and hopefully, this time, they might actually finish the tour without her ending up in hospital and on the front page of every country music website in the world. Which was why it was a very, very, very bad idea to get involved with her therapist... former therapist. Gabe Rousso had thought he had contained his attraction to the feisty violinist. That was until that last session when an innocent kiss on the cheek had turned into something a whole lot hotter. He wasn't technically her therapist anymore, which was why he'd accepted her invitation to see her perform for the first time since her breakdown. He shouldn't have gone... but he did and of course that had led to more compromising of his closely guarded ethics. She was a weakness he couldn't afford and a temptation he couldn't resist. This is a standalone romance - no cliff-hanger! *This is a 'Too Hot to Handle' romance on the Emma Lea rating scale - These are definitely 18+ reads and contain graphic sex scenes and high level swearing - not for the faint of heart.",

        "description": "APublisher’s Weekly Best Books of the Year Selection A Publishers Marketplace Buzz Books Selection A Bookpage Most Anticipated Romances Selection From the USA Today bestselling author of Island Affair comes the story of three dazzling sisters brimming with talent, ambition—and passion—in a warm-hearted, sexy new series filled with Latinx culture, family drama, and women pursuing their dreams against all odds. Fans of The Worst Best Man by Mia Sosa, Well Met by Jen DeLuca, and You Had Me At Hola by Alexis Daria. Growing up, Lilí María Fernandez was affectionately known as the family “wild child.” The life of the party, she loved to dance, especially salsa, merengue, and bachata, and often sang beside her father during rehearsals for his trío group. But tragedy and loss have drawn out Lilí’s caretaking side, compelling her to become a victim’s advocate. These days, the special rhythms of the past seem like a distant memory. Until she meets Diego Reyes . . . A police officer with the Chicago PD, Diego also has a talent for playing classical Spanish guitar. And Lilí soon finds herself inspired by his passion—for the music, for her, and for their shared love of familia and community. Can Diego reignite Lilí’s fun-loving spirit, persuade her to balance work and pleasure—and embrace her wild side once more? Praise for THEIR PERFECT MELODY: “Oliveras’s tangled, topical conflicts between multidimensional characters blend with lovingly portrayed family life and an intricate, realistic plot, enmeshing the reader in her created world.” —Publishers Weekly, STARRED REVIEW “Lili, who teaches self-defense and helps women in danger, is an appealing and uniquely powerful heroine, and Diego’s arc is also well crafted by rising star Oliveras, and the chemistry between him and Lili burns through the pages. Readers will love the loving but interfering family scenes. . . .

        "description": "From award-winning author Tara Wyatt comes a sexy contemporary standalone romance set during a steamy Boston summer. If smartass carpenter Adam Hennessey hadn't stood up Charlie Grant over a year ago, he might not find himself on the other side of a slammed door. But when Adam volunteers to repair Charlie's deck as a favor to a friend, that's exactly where he finds himself. Does he regret standing her up? Yes. Does he find the cynical, sarcastic sports journalist unbearably sexy? Also yes. Does she hate his guts? All the yes. Charlie's not the forgiving type, especially after a broken heart in the past has left her jaded, but she can't deny that Adam, with his beard, tattoos and panty-melting smile (oh, and muscles--can't forget to mention the muscles) might just be winning her over. With a second chance on the line, Charlie will have to decide if getting nailed by the smoking hot carpenter is worth the risk.",

Tyler Jacobson has a plan for everything—except how to handle his completely annoying, utterly frustrating, and totally sexy upstairs neighbor. He couldn’t care less if Everly Ribinski thinks he’s equally irritating—until he discovers she’s the only one who can help him land a business deal that will finally make him feel like he’s more than just a guy from the wrong side of the tracks. Color him shocked when Everly refuses to help, insisting she should have run him over in the parking garage when she had the chance. Harsh. But possibly deserved. Tyler may have spent the last few months reveling in annoying the fiery gallery owner with a dark past, but he’s got secret leverage she can’t refuse. If only they could stop trying to one-up each other long enough to realize the pranks are nothing more than foreplay. Of course, he figures it out quicker. He's smart like that. Too bad Everly wants nothing to do with him. Or does she? Wait. What is she up to now? For a man who’s always scheming, the best-laid plans never felt so good falling apart... Each book in the Harbor City series is STANDALONE * The Negotiator * The Charmer * The Schemer",

        "description": "Her luck is about to change forever... Hailey hasn't had much luck in her life. Not with her art career. Certainly not with her string of loser boyfriends. Or with her deadbeat brother, Dan, fresh out of prison. But after a long shift at the hotel, she bumps into Travis, her brother's best friend from high school and the guy she'd crushed on for years. Only now Travis is a red-hot country music star, and she can't believe how much hotter he is now than he was when they were kids. Travis is a country music sensation, a success story from the down-and-out town of Echo. He and his partner, Asher, have been together for years, and he'd always thought Asher was enough for him, on stage and in bed. But when he runs into Hailey in Nashville, he can't believe the feelings and memories that come rushing back. He'd loved his friend's little sister from afar, and if it hadn't been for Dan's violent streak, he would have definitely asked her out. But back then, he hadn't been man enough to take on his best friend. Asher's old-money family never accepted who or what Asher was, so he made his own way in the music business, playing with Travis and running a successful record label. But when Travis introduces him to Hailey, it's as if everything in his life has fallen into place. A threesome with Hailey is just what both of them need. The sex is scorching, and it's soon clear their love will not be complete without her. But when Hailey's brother finds out she's involved with Travis and Asher, the past returns to threaten their new love. And it'll take all three of them to fight for the love they deserve... Reader note: contains MMF ménage, hot romance elements, and male male love. A complete, stand-alone story with a happily ever after",

Nathaniel, Duke of Rothhaven, lives in seclusion, leaving his property only to gallop his demon-black steed across the moors by moonlight. Exasperated mamas invoke his name to frighten small children, though Nathaniel is truly a decent man - maybe too decent for his own good. That's precisely why he must turn away the beguiling woman demanding his help. Lady Althea Wentworth has little patience for dukes, reclusive or otherwise, but she needs Rothhaven's backing to gain entrance into Polite Society. She's asked him nicely, she's called on him politely, all to no avail - until her prize hogs just happen to plunder the ducal orchard. He longs for privacy. She's vowed to never endure another ball as a wallflower. Yet as the two grow closer, it soon becomes clear they might both be pretending to be something they're not. Find out why readers LOVE Grace Burrowes 'Grace Burrowes is a romance treasure' Tessa Dare 'Smart, sexy, and oh-so romantic' Mary Balogh 'Wonderfully funny, moving romance, not to be missed!' Eloisa James 'If you're not reading Grace Burrowes you're missing the very best in today's Regency Romance!' Elizabeth Hoyt",

But it isn’t the hands of the attractive redhead that he took a drink off. Pleasure soon takes over any sort of propriety, and he gives in to the lust building in to him. Dragging the three over to a nearby grove, the pounding of Mimic Fist becomes the background music to a pounding of another sort, as George takes the three of them wantonly and without restraint.

        "description": "From a New York Times bestselling author, an irreverent, heartwarming romp in which a spirited social director must navigate romance, an uppity boss, quirky friends, and the family no one wants in order to find her own happily ever after. \"You look like the woman I'd spend the rest of my life regretting I'd missed out on. That's all.\" \"Utterly charming.\" ~Round Table Reviews Shannon is so over being the black sheep of her overachieving family. As the sassy social director at an uppity Boston law firm, she's overworked, underappreciated, and dateless for her sister's upcoming wedding. The easy fix to her problems? Say yes to her family-favorite ex-boyfriend. But is he the right guy for her, or an easy escape from her life? When an intern revolt puts Shannon on probation at work, she's in danger of being the failure her family believes she is. The only one willing to stand by her? The guy she's trying to get over. But when a longtime family friend she's always had a crush on finally notices her, suddenly she has a new choice to make. With romance heating up in more than one direction and a career at risk, the stakes rise for Shannon to find the path that's right for her before she makes a choice she'll regret forever. Author's Note: Sassy, spirited heroine. Love triangle. Friends to lovers. A swoon-worthy hero. Workplace romance-that's-not-a-romance. Country club sex. The family you love to hate. Light-hearted fun. Secrets. Bff's. A sociopathic boss. And a heart-melting happily ever after. \"Endearing and quirky!\" ~Chicklitbooks.com \"I loved just about everything about this book.\" ~Awarded a Top Pick from Romance Readers at the Heart Reviews About the Author: Stephanie Rowe is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of more than fifty novels. She is a RITA® Award winner, and a five-time nominee for this prestigious award. In addition to sassy, fun contemporary romance, she also writes paranormal romance, romantic suspense, and heartwarming small-town contemporary romance, including her bestselling Wyoming Rebels cowboy series.",

        "description": "This carefully crafted ebook: \"The Birthmark (Psychological Thriller)\" is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents. Excerpt: \"One day, very soon after their marriage, Aylmer sat gazing at his wife with a trouble in his countenance that grew stronger until he spoke. \"Georgiana,\" said he, \"has it never occurred to you that the mark upon your cheek might be removed?\" (The Birthmark) The Birthmark deals with the husband's deeply negative obsession of his wife's outer appearances and what does that entail for these two young couples. The birthmark represents various things throughout the story. Two of the main representations are imperfection and mortality. American novelist and short story writer Nathaniel Hawthorne's (1804-1864) writing centers on New England, many works featuring moral allegories with a Puritan inspiration. Hawthorne has also written a few poems which many people are not aware of. His works are considered to be part of the Romantic movement and, more specifically, Dark romanticism. His themes often centre on the inherent evil and sin of humanity, and his works often have moral messages and deep psychological complexity.",

World-renowned rock bassist/vocalist, Ramiro Espinoza, of the thrash metal band \"Irate\" seemed to have it all on stage, but behind the scenes things were far from perfect. He grew up in a religious household, where his father threw Bible verses in his face while he, his mother and sister endured lots of physical and emotional abuse. Rock/Heavy Metal was an outlet for Ramiro, where he learned to play the bass guitar and found his voice to sing. On top of that, he wrote lyrics about his bad relationship with his father and things in the world that vexed him. He and two bandmates formed a trio with an aggressive, fast sound that captivated fans by the millions. His fiance, Noelle, a House/Techno Songstress gave up gigs singing at small venues in New York to tour with Ramiro around the world. While on tour, he would put Noelle's style of music down, belittle her before everyone, and even got physical. Without hesitation, she left Ramiro right in the middle of his tour. Ramiro knew he couldn't fight his demons on his own and needed professional help. His manager arranged for a counselor to tour with this Heavy Metal god, holding sessions between shows. Ramiro needed to make things right so Noelle would walk down the aisle. His father who has made Ramiro's life a living hell as a child, resurfaced to annihilate his future. Now, Ramiro must confront this demon in human form.",

        "description": "Genre: Rockstar Pop Star Romance / Full Figured Romance Jodi's a roadie, and she’s set her heart on the hottest country music rockstar on the planet—Blake Brooks. But after six desperate months on the road, she’s no closer to launching her music career, or even scoring some hot and heavy close-up time with the tall, dark and handsome rockstar. As for Blake… well, fame, fortune, and a legion of willing female would be the stuff of most musician's wet dreams. Pity the women falling all over him don't have what he really craves – a body with curves. Can they solve each other's problems and find in each other what they've both been searching for? This 10,500+ word stand-alone full figure romance contains detailed descriptions of sex with an alpha male musician. This is a steamy short intended for the enjoyment of adults who love rockstar love stories with a dash of romance.",

        "description": "This early work Romance by Ford Madox Ford was originally published in 1903 and we are now republishing it with a brand new introduction. Ford Madox Ford was born Ford Madox Hueffer in Merton, Surrey, England on 17th December 1873. The creative arts ran in his family - Hueffer's grandfather, Ford Madox Brown, was a well-known painter, and his German émigré father was music critic of The Times - and after a brief dalliance with music composition, the young Hueffer began to write. Although Hueffer never attended university, during his early twenties he moved through many intellectual circles, and would later talk of the influence that the \"Middle Victorian, tumultuously bearded Great\" - men such as John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle - exerted on him. In 1908, Hueffer founded the English Review, and over the next 15 months published Thomas Hardy, H. G. Wells, Joseph Conrad, Henry James, John Galsworthy and W. B. Yeats, and gave débuts to many authors, including D. H. Lawrence and Norman Douglas. Hueffer's editorship consolidated the classic canon of early modernist literature and saw him earn a reputation as of one of the century's greatest literary editors. Ford's most famous work was his Parade's End tetralogy, which he completed in the 1920's and have now been adapted into a BBC television drama. Ford continued to write through the thirties, producing fiction, non-fiction, and two volumes of autobiography: Return to Yesterday (1931) and It was the Nightingale (1933). In his last years, he taught literature at the Olivet College in Michigan. Ford died on 26th June 1939 in Deauville, France, at the age of 65.",

In his teens he goes to live it up in the exciting night district of Kings Cross. He meets artists of all kinds and discovers his own artistic sensibilities. After graduation from university he makes a career as an architect, retires, goes to London, and then in 1990 settles in Paris. From Paris, for the next 25 years, he discovers the world through the lens of his camera. He writes it all down. Jim’s story begins with childhood memories of his life in a gritty inner city suburb of Sydney. It was wild and exciting for a five year-old but for his asthmatic mother the toxic environment was intolerable. They move and become the pioneers in a new outer bush suburb. In teenage he finds a room in the night district of Kings Cross, mixes with artists and discovers his own sensibilities. He goes to university, graduates, and makes his career as an architect. He retires in 1989 and then takes residence in Paris. This begins a second life of travel and writing. His story is enriched by his wonderful, keenly observed descriptions of places, as exotically various as the Zen Buddhist temple he sojourned in Kyoto; Maharashtra, where he photographed traditional farm and village life; the slums of Calcutta where he nearly died; Havana, where he learned what living under communism is like; Moscow and St. Petersburg at the fall of the Soviet Union; Manhattan during the first Obama election, Istanbul, Jerusalem, Krakow, Florence, Hong Kong, and small provincial towns in France. But it is other people that interest us most. He meets with so many types, each remarkable in their own ways. His story is easy to read, not without humour, and lyrical in style.",

Meanwhile there are individual lives to be led, being born, growing, thriving, loving, surviving and dying to be negotiated, dreams to pursue in a world of change coming at us at the speed of light.

But there might be a few similarities in its inhabitants. . . Cate Kendall is no stranger to daydreams of brooding men and fancy parties--after all, she teaches one of her beloved Jane Austen novels in her English classes every year. But as for romance or adventure in her own life, the highlight of most weeks is Scrabble with her cute coworker, Ethan, and he draws the line at witty banter. But Cate is ready for a change. When she finds a mysterious journal that seems to have a link to the soul of the great Jane Austen herself, she knows it's her chance. And she grabs on with both hands. . . Before she knows it, Cate has invented an alter ego with an attitude, attended some seriously chic soirees, and gotten tangled up with a delicious mystery man. And she's uncovered enough unexpected secrets about Ethan that her Scrabble partner has taken to brooding looks and unfathomable silences. It's a positively Austenite predicament, and Cate is sure she'll land in hot water and heartbreak--but maybe not with Jane herself to guide her. . . \"Sexy, saucy, fun! Jane Austen would be proud!\" --Sophie Jordan, New York Times bestselling author Praise for Austentatious \"Frothy, fun, and full of juicy secrets, Alyssa Goodnight's Austen-inspired romp is no Plain Jane.\" --Erin Blakemore \"Will appeal to all Austen fans while bringing a fresh twist with its magic journal.\" --Booklist \"Kept me turning the pages way past my bedtime.\" --Cindy Jones, author of My Jane Austen Summer",

Brothers Nestor and Cesar Camillo arrive from Cuba in 1949 with dreams of becoming famous mambo musicians. This memorable novel traces the arc of the two brothers’ lives—one charismatic and macho, the other soulful and sensitive—from Havana to New York, from East Coast clubs and dance halls to the heights of musical fame. The basis for a popular film, The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love “tells of the triumphs and tragedies that befall two men blessed with gigantic appetites and profoundly melancholic hearts. . . . Hijuelos has depicted a world as enchanting as that in Garcia Marquez’s Love in the Time of Cholera” (Publishers Weekly). “Rich and provocative . . . a moving portrait of a man, his family, a community and a time.” —Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times",

From the moment when he realizes that the musicians have to perform in a freezing cellar underneath the royal apartments, he understands that he's come to a place where the opposing states of light and dark, good and evil, are waging war to the death. Designated the king's \"Angel\" because of his good looks, he finds himself falling in love with the young woman who is the companion of the king's adulterous and estranged wife, Kirsten. With his loyalties fatally divided, how will Peter Claire find the path that will realize his hopes and save his soul? With a sure, alchemical touch and the narrative finesse that always turns her histories into a kind of magic, Rose Tremain has fashioned a rich, provocative historical romance as pungent as Denmark's salty air. This is a tale of opposites: light and darkness, tenderness and violence, music and silence.",

Every night, she stands offstage, watching rock star Xan Valentine and his band, Killer Valentine, set fire to the crowd with music until they would burn down the city for him. His music wraps her until her fingers dance, desperately wanting the piano, but her terrified legs could never walk onto a stage. Most nights, when Xan Valentine strides off the stage, his dark eyes shift, blurring, and he becomes Alexandre de Valentinois again. Sometimes, Xan won’t let go. Some of the other band members, Rade and Grayson, are caught in a death spiral of booze, drugs, and groupies. The drummer, Tryp, is too infatuated with his new wife to do more than show up to play. Xan is the only one who can compel them onto the stage. He’s holding Killer Valentine together with the force of his will. This can’t go on. Something has to break. USA Today Bestselling Author Blair Babylon writes bestselling romance books that will free your mind. These five star billionaire boss, enemies to lovers, friends to lovers, and romantic comedy romantic novels quickly turn into suspense thriller books that will make your pulse pound and soothe your heart. Whether the couple are trapped in a pretend marriage or there’s only one bed, Blair’s books are like romancing your own duke, mister, or billionaire. Some are an ugly cry, some are an affair to remember with a king or a prince, and some are a few shades darker, but all are unputdownable. Fans of Danielle Steel, E.L. James, Helen Hardt, Anna Todd, and Charlotte Byrd will love Blair's romantic books and romance audiobooks. Set your heart free and download these fantastic, complete series!",

        "description": "You know me as rock goddess Kyle Summers. But you don’t know me. Not really. For instance, you probably don’t know that playing the guitar is all I ever wanted to do with my life. And I’m sure you don’t know that I used to be boy crazy. Till him. Till I met rock star CJ Slavin. I knew from the moment I met him that he completes me, that we belong together…that, in his shadow, no other man will ever do. So why have we never been able to make it work? Why can we never fully commit to one another? Can we find a way to be together or am I destined to be alone? What reviewers have said about the trilogy: “This author does it right. She doesn’t just throw the rockstar title around. Nope, she gives her readers what they crave. You can go in knowing you’re gonna get the whole experience. The music that flows through the veins of the born-to-rock characters. The song lyrics that speak to you because you recognize the emotion they were written with. The passion of a music lover that flows through the pages of your kindle and reaches you as the story unfolds. The excitement of being there when the magic happens.” Rosa Sharon, iScream Books “It was with the release of this series that Jade was dubbed ‘the Queen of Rock Romance,’ and there is no mistaking that it is a title that fits.” MaryLou, PagePrincess “Omg the Queen of Rock truly outdid herself with this book.” Angie J, Twinsie Talk Book Blog “Wow...and YES!!! If the Nicki Sosebee series and the Bullet boys had a baby, I think this would be the result. I have always been a huge fan of Jamison's work, whether she wrote about a naughty, sexy reporter and her bedroom antics or about a hot young rock band with a lot of angst and serious problems.” Sue Banner",

        "description": "This study seeks to identify Ros de Olano's specific innovations and departures from Romanticism through a comparative study of his work and its precedents and contemporaries throughout Europe, with a view to later developments. It explores his literary engagement with the legacy of transcendental idealism and the autobiographical traditions. His privileging of incident and episode over more conventional narrative, his favouring of irreconcileability over resolution is explained and placed in a detailed context. In searching for alternatives to his literary problems, he makes a remarkable contribution to Spanish prose literature.",

Tragedy, infidelity, heartbreak: the midlist romance author has suffered it all. She was strong enough to run, like a spunky heroine from one of her novels, and soon she’ll be flying…just as soon as she can walk again. After walking from Portland to Sacramento, Shayna wakes up in the hospital with famous rock star, Dante Deity offering to take her to his mansion to recuperate. Unlike her abusive ex-husband or her bullying mother, Dante is determined she succeed. As he helps her recover from her grief and get her writing back, a romance worthy of her novels blooms. But Shayna knows that they can’t have a healthy loving relationship until she learns to stand on her own. AND THE ROCK GOD Dante Deity is revered by everyone who knows anything about heavy metal music, and he’s respected by everyone else. Rich, handsome, and successful, he has a voice like velvet-wrapped lightning. He juggles numerous philanthropic ventures while cranking out hits. When he’s on tour, music is his life. When he’s taking a break, he’s thinking about his next tour—or working on a project that helps him forget he’s alone. When an unconscious woman falls into his arms, Dante embarks on the biggest project of his life. Saving a damsel in distress quickly becomes a secondary mission when he realizes that his heart is on the line.",

By chance, Parker Devareau, meets Ella while rushing home to get behind the safety of her Full Moon Bars on a full moon night. Parker can see, hear and feel things that no ordinary person can. When Ella saves Parker from a breach of the protective city walls caused by the druids, Parker sees something beyond the impression of a schizophrenic with multiple personalities who is constantly talking to someone who is not there. And the truth breaks her heart. The women stand together with the Red Hood and Gretta Snow to save the people of the city who perceive them all as monsters.",

Perfect for fans of Jessica Lemmon, Lauren Blakely and Emma Chase. Jenny Dawson moved to Nashville to write music, not get famous. But when her latest record goes double platinum, Jenny's suddenly one of the town's biggest stars - and the center of a tabloid scandal connecting her with a pop star she's barely even met. With paparazzi tracking her every move, Jenny flees to a remote mansion in Louisiana to write her next album. The only hiccup is the unexpected presence of a brooding young caretaker named Noah, whose foul mouth and snap judgments lead to constant bickering - and serious heat. Noah really should tell Jenny that he's Preston Noah Maxwell Walcott, the owner of the estate where the feisty country singer has made her spoiled self at home. But the charade gives Noah a much-needed break from his own troubles, and before long, their verbal sparring is indistinguishable from foreplay. But as sizzling nights give way to quiet pillow talk, Noah begins to realize that Jenny's almost as complicated as he is. To fit into each other's lives, they'll need the courage to face their problems together - before the outside world catches up to them. Want more fun, fresh, flirty and very sexy rom-com? Check out the titles in the Oxford series, beginning with Irresistibly Yours, and don't miss the warm, witty and sexy Wedding Belles series.",

Hailed as one of the greatest pop singers of her generation, Samantha Miles seems to have it all. It’s through her music that she reaches out to fans, offers them hope, and entertains them with a vivacious passion unlike any other artist. Her rise to fame is marked by a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, music awards, and multiple record deal offers from America to the UK. Although immensely wealthy, Samantha finds herself vulnerable at the hands of an obsessed fan who tries to harm her.

It is an incident-filled tale of young, talented Anastasia Grey’s search for success. Her rise from obscurity to celebrity is told against a background of romance, music, sudden and mysterious death and final triumph. “Ms. Bishop has done it again with this perceptive, cleverly crafted suspense. I don’t know which I enjoyed more – her colorful characters or her wit and understatement that provoked frequent outbursts of laughter. A fun read. Oh yes, there is a murder.” —Joanne Dearcopp, co-author of The Nature of Joy “As Anna Gray remakes herself into the captivating Anastasia, she transforms the people around her as well. For better or worse, no one is untouched by the effects of Anastasia’s dynamic persona.” —Kia Heavey, author of Night Machines",

Annie Murphy, a transit bus driver in Snowside, Vermont, loves scavenger hunts and the corny jokes her riders share. She has a heart as big as the city and gave up college to raise her orphaned nephew without a second thought. But so far true love has eluded her. A downturn in the economy five years ago sent Jack Davidson down a path to enlightenment. Giving up a lucrative career in finance and his swanky high-rise apartment, he invested all his savings to start Job Hunters 4 You, a nonprofit that helps the unemployed find work. The only thing missing is that special someone in his life. Jody and Nick Claws arrive on Jack’s doorstep in matching red and green plaid flannel shirts, the spitting image of Mr. and Mrs. Santa Claus. The pair are on a mission to work their Christmas magic on two lonely hearts—Annie and Jack. Grab your copy today because nothing kicks off the holidays like a match made in heaven.",

        "description": "\". . . the perfect balance between serious chemistry and warm, tender moments.\" ~Meline Naseau When Right Meets Left, Sparks Fly and Mistrust Abounds in THE POLITICS OF LOVE, a Romantic Comedy by Ines Saint -- Chicago, Present Day -- By most accounts, Jake Kelly is a cold, rich, white-guy. He's also Chicago's conservative mayoral candidate who genuinely loves his city and doesn’t understand why voters want to know the \"real\" Jake. Warm, sassy and opinionated, Kayla Diaz is an accomplished music teacher and violinist. She also loves Chicago, is trying to get back to her city and needs a job-- a \"comfortable\" marriage and family would be nice too. When a friend brings them together to come up with a music program for the city’s public school system as part of Jake’s plans for education reform, sparks ignite and combustion follows. But, after photos of the two of them dancing close at a festival mysteriously show up in local media, things get complicated. Voters love the idea of Jake and Kayla together, but they have it all wrong . . . or do they? Can Kayla trust that Jake wants her for the right reasons or is this just THE POLITICS OF LOVE? Publisher's Note: This book was previously published as STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT and has been updated and edited by the author. Readers who appreciate sweet romance without erotic detail will enjoy THE POLITICS OF LOVE. Fans of Kristan Higgins, Marie Force, Bella Andre, Catherine Bybee as well as fans of sweet, clean romance will not want to miss Ines Saint. \"The chemistry with both characters blends in beautifully. I like that the sex scenes are left to the reader's imagination and not outright explicit like other books.\" ~Marlene R. Meet Ines Saint: Born in Zaragoza, Spain and raised in the United States and Puerto Rico, Inés Saint is bilingual and bicultural and knows what it’s like to feel like you belong everywhere, but not quite anywhere. Right now, she is raising her fun, inspiring teens, volunteering for causes she believes in, working on her writing career, and sharing her life with her dream guy. Her greatest joys are spending time with family and close friends, working with kids, reading, and traveling.",

Robert Rothmere is hiding a past no duke should have endured, but he's not hiding it well enough. Sooner or later, his enemies will learn that he spent years locked away at a private asylum. To get their hands on his wealth, they'll try to send him right back to his worst nightmares. If Robert is to foil their schemes, he needs to marry a perfectly proper, blessedly boring, deadly dull duchess, immediately - and he knows exactly which quietly delightful lady he'd love in that role. Lady Constance Wentworth has cultivated a reputation for utter forgettability. She never speaks out of turn (in public), never has a daring thought (that she admits aloud), and never comes close to courting scandal . . . as far as anybody knows. But years ago, her path crossed Robert's and she's never forgotten the extraordinary lengths he travelled to keep her safe when she hadn't a friend in the world. She longs to be his demure duchess . . . but little does he know that to marry her would be utter madness. Praise for Grace Burrowes 'Grace Burrowes is a romance treasure' Tessa Dare 'Smart, sexy, and oh-so romantic' Mary Balogh 'Wonderfully funny, moving romance, not to be missed!' Eloisa James 'If you're not reading Grace Burrowes you're missing the very best in today's Regency Romance!' Elizabeth Hoyt",

The discovery could secure him fame and fortune for life-but he is willing to bury it again forever . . . . . . to spend one night with the treasure's owner, the most beautiful woman who ever lived: Helen, Princess of Troy.

Just like their settings, the stories depict a blend of the modern and the traditional, of a drive for the future and memories from the past, of a longing for a home and a fear of being grounded -- and a struggle to reconcile these contradicting desires. At the end of the book, you will understand what makes Seoul one of the most interesting and complex landscapes for literature.",

But there might be a few similarities in its inhabitants. . . Cate Kendall is no stranger to daydreams of brooding men and fancy parties--after all, she teaches one of her beloved Jane Austen novels in her English classes every year. But as for romance or adventure in her own life, the highlight of most weeks is Scrabble with her cute coworker, Ethan, and he draws the line at witty banter. But Cate is ready for a change. When she finds a mysterious journal that seems to have a link to the soul of the great Jane Austen herself, she knows it's her chance. And she grabs on with both hands. . . Before she knows it, Cate has invented an alter ego with an attitude, attended some seriously chic soirees, and gotten tangled up with a delicious mystery man. And she's uncovered enough unexpected secrets about Ethan that her Scrabble partner has taken to brooding looks and unfathomable silences. It's a positively Austenite predicament, and Cate is sure she'll land in hot water and heartbreak--but maybe not with Jane herself to guide her. . . \"Sexy, saucy, fun! Jane Austen would be proud!\" --Sophie Jordan, New York Times bestselling author Praise for Austentatious \"Frothy, fun, and full of juicy secrets, Alyssa Goodnight's Austen-inspired romp is no Plain Jane.\" --Erin Blakemore \"Will appeal to all Austen fans while bringing a fresh twist with its magic journal.\" --Booklist \"Kept me turning the pages way past my bedtime.\" --Cindy Jones, author of My Jane Austen Summer",

Or with her deadbeat brother, Dan, fresh out of prison. But after a long shift at the hotel, she bumps into Travis, her brother's best friend from high school and the guy she'd crushed on for years. Only now Travis is a red-hot country music star, and she can't believe how much hotter he is now than he was when they were kids. Travis is a country music sensation, a success story from the down-and-out town of Echo. He and his partner, Asher, have been together for years, and he'd always thought Asher was enough for him, on stage and in bed. But when he runs into Hailey in Nashville, he can't believe the feelings and memories that come rushing back. He'd loved his friend's little sister from afar, and if it hadn't been for Dan's violent streak, he would have definitely asked her out. But back then, he hadn't been man enough to take on his best friend. Asher's old-money family never accepted who or what Asher was, so he made his own way in the music business, playing with Travis and running a successful record label. But when Travis introduces him to Hailey, it's as if everything in his life has fallen into place. A threesome with Hailey is just what both of them need. The sex is scorching, and it's soon clear their love will not be complete without her. But when Hailey's brother finds out she's involved with Travis and Asher, the past returns to threaten their new love. And it'll take all three of them to fight for the love they deserve... Reader note: contains MMF ménage, hot romance elements, and male male love. A complete, stand-alone story with a happily ever after",

Nathaniel, Duke of Rothhaven, lives in seclusion, leaving his property only to gallop his demon-black steed across the moors by moonlight. Exasperated mamas invoke his name to frighten small children, though Nathaniel is truly a decent man - maybe too decent for his own good. That's precisely why he must turn away the beguiling woman demanding his help. Lady Althea Wentworth has little patience for dukes, reclusive or otherwise, but she needs Rothhaven's backing to gain entrance into Polite Society. She's asked him nicely, she's called on him politely, all to no avail - until her prize hogs just happen to plunder the ducal orchard. He longs for privacy. She's vowed to never endure another ball as a wallflower. Yet as the two grow closer, it soon becomes clear they might both be pretending to be something they're not. Find out why readers LOVE Grace Burrowes 'Grace Burrowes is a romance treasure' Tessa Dare 'Smart, sexy, and oh-so romantic' Mary Balogh 'Wonderfully funny, moving romance, not to be missed!' Eloisa James 'If you're not reading Grace Burrowes you're missing the very best in today's Regency Romance!' Elizabeth Hoyt",

        "description": "'Just trust me when I say that My Christmas Number One will be unlike any other Christmas read you have picked up.' ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ There’s nothing quite like a Christmas love story, to get you in the mood for celebrating... Cara doesn’t do sexy and she only does ‘Happy Christmas’ under duress. She is, after all, a serious musician, and her stubborn streak is born from her struggle to recover from a serious injury. Javi lives for escapist fun - in his music, and in his life - especially since he’s always failed at life’s more serious challenges, including marriage and fatherhood. Javi and Cara are forced to record a Christmas single together, but neither of them have plans to spend any more time with each other than they absolutely have to. With Christmas traditions that couldn’t be more different, and outlooks on life that are worlds apart, the chemistry just shouldn’t work. But the magic of Christmas can bring even opposites together... From the snowy beauty of London at Christmas, to the candle-lit magic of Javi’s traditional family celebrations, let Leonie Mack whisk you away on a memorable festive adventure. Perfect for fans of Trisha Ashley, Mandy Baggot and Holly Martin. What readers are saying about My Christmas Number One: 'Just trust me when I say that My Christmas Number One will be unlike any other Christmas read you have picked up.'

World-renowned rock bassist/vocalist, Ramiro Espinoza, of the thrash metal band \"Irate\" seemed to have it all on stage, but behind the scenes things were far from perfect. He grew up in a religious household, where his father threw Bible verses in his face while he, his mother and sister endured lots of physical and emotional abuse. Rock/Heavy Metal was an outlet for Ramiro, where he learned to play the bass guitar and found his voice to sing. On top of that, he wrote lyrics about his bad relationship with his father and things in the world that vexed him. He and two bandmates formed a trio with an aggressive, fast sound that captivated fans by the millions. His fiance, Noelle, a House/Techno Songstress gave up gigs singing at small venues in New York to tour with Ramiro around the world. While on tour, he would put Noelle's style of music down, belittle her before everyone, and even got physical. Without hesitation, she left Ramiro right in the middle of his tour. Ramiro knew he couldn't fight his demons on his own and needed professional help. His manager arranged for a counselor to tour with this Heavy Metal god, holding sessions between shows. Ramiro needed to make things right so Noelle would walk down the aisle. His father who has made Ramiro's life a living hell as a child, resurfaced to annihilate his future. Now, Ramiro must confront this demon in human form.",

This work explores the changing American discourse as a contrapuntal rope consisting of three symbolic elements/threads interacting in a unique way in the periods of realism/naturalism, modernism, and postmodernism.",

        "description": "This early work Romance by Ford Madox Ford was originally published in 1903 and we are now republishing it with a brand new introduction. Ford Madox Ford was born Ford Madox Hueffer in Merton, Surrey, England on 17th December 1873. The creative arts ran in his family - Hueffer's grandfather, Ford Madox Brown, was a well-known painter, and his German émigré father was music critic of The Times - and after a brief dalliance with music composition, the young Hueffer began to write. Although Hueffer never attended university, during his early twenties he moved through many intellectual circles, and would later talk of the influence that the \"Middle Victorian, tumultuously bearded Great\" - men such as John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle - exerted on him. In 1908, Hueffer founded the English Review, and over the next 15 months published Thomas Hardy, H. G. Wells, Joseph Conrad, Henry James, John Galsworthy and W. B. Yeats, and gave débuts to many authors, including D. H. Lawrence and Norman Douglas. Hueffer's editorship consolidated the classic canon of early modernist literature and saw him earn a reputation as of one of the century's greatest literary editors. Ford's most famous work was his Parade's End tetralogy, which he completed in the 1920's and have now been adapted into a BBC television drama. Ford continued to write through the thirties, producing fiction, non-fiction, and two volumes of autobiography: Return to Yesterday (1931) and It was the Nightingale (1933). In his last years, he taught literature at the Olivet College in Michigan. Ford died on 26th June 1939 in Deauville, France, at the age of 65.",

From the moment when he realizes that the musicians have to perform in a freezing cellar underneath the royal apartments, he understands that he's come to a place where the opposing states of light and dark, good and evil, are waging war to the death. Designated the king's \"Angel\" because of his good looks, he finds himself falling in love with the young woman who is the companion of the king's adulterous and estranged wife, Kirsten. With his loyalties fatally divided, how will Peter Claire find the path that will realize his hopes and save his soul? With a sure, alchemical touch and the narrative finesse that always turns her histories into a kind of magic, Rose Tremain has fashioned a rich, provocative historical romance as pungent as Denmark's salty air. This is a tale of opposites: light and darkness, tenderness and violence, music and silence.",

Every night, she stands offstage, watching rock star Xan Valentine and his band, Killer Valentine, set fire to the crowd with music until they would burn down the city for him. His music wraps her until her fingers dance, desperately wanting the piano, but her terrified legs could never walk onto a stage. Most nights, when Xan Valentine strides off the stage, his dark eyes shift, blurring, and he becomes Alexandre de Valentinois again. Sometimes, Xan won’t let go. Some of the other band members, Rade and Grayson, are caught in a death spiral of booze, drugs, and groupies. The drummer, Tryp, is too infatuated with his new wife to do more than show up to play. Xan is the only one who can compel them onto the stage. He’s holding Killer Valentine together with the force of his will. This can’t go on. Something has to break. USA Today Bestselling Author Blair Babylon writes bestselling romance books that will free your mind. These five star billionaire boss, enemies to lovers, friends to lovers, and romantic comedy romantic novels quickly turn into suspense thriller books that will make your pulse pound and soothe your heart. Whether the couple are trapped in a pretend marriage or there’s only one bed, Blair’s books are like romancing your own duke, mister, or billionaire. Some are an ugly cry, some are an affair to remember with a king or a prince, and some are a few shades darker, but all are unputdownable. Fans of Danielle Steel, E.L. James, Helen Hardt, Anna Todd, and Charlotte Byrd will love Blair's romantic books and romance audiobooks. Set your heart free and download these fantastic, complete series!",

Till I met rock star CJ Slavin. I knew from the moment I met him that he completes me, that we belong together…that, in his shadow, no other man will ever do. So why have we never been able to make it work? Why can we never fully commit to one another? Can we find a way to be together or am I destined to be alone? What reviewers have said about the trilogy: “This author does it right. She doesn’t just throw the rockstar title around. Nope, she gives her readers what they crave. You can go in knowing you’re gonna get the whole experience. The music that flows through the veins of the born-to-rock characters. The song lyrics that speak to you because you recognize the emotion they were written with. The passion of a music lover that flows through the pages of your kindle and reaches you as the story unfolds. The excitement of being there when the magic happens.” Rosa Sharon, iScream Books “It was with the release of this series that Jade was dubbed ‘the Queen of Rock Romance,’ and there is no mistaking that it is a title that fits.” MaryLou, PagePrincess “Omg the Queen of Rock truly outdid herself with this book.” Angie J, Twinsie Talk Book Blog “Wow...and YES!!! If the Nicki Sosebee series and the Bullet boys had a baby, I think this would be the result. I have always been a huge fan of Jamison's work, whether she wrote about a naughty, sexy reporter and her bedroom antics or about a hot young rock band with a lot of angst and serious problems.” Sue Banner",

        "description": "Strip-club waitress. Aspiring teacher. Friend of the Heaven Hill MC. Bianca Hawks met Jagger Stone in the most embarrassing of ways. After watching him play music at Wet Wanda’s for months, she fell half naked into his arms after a drunken bout with a stripper pole and the back of a pick-up truck. Avoiding him and his killer smile no longer works when she needs her car repaired and he comes to her rescue. His request for payment comes in the form of date nights spent with just the two of them – away from both the strip club and the MC. Tough guy with model good looks. Talented musician. Newly patched member of the Heaven Hill MC. Jagger Stone only wanted two things – to be a patched member of the Heaven Hill MC and to get to know Bianca Hawks. One for two isn’t bad, but when her car breaks down and she’s left with no one else to help her, he plays the situation to his advantage. Over late nights driving up and down the interstate and nights in spent at her apartment, Jagger realizes that there is so much more to Bianca than he ever knew. When her dream of becoming a school teacher is threatened by someone who wants her all to himself, the two of them are thrown into a dangerous game of cat and mouse. For the first time, Heaven Hill isn’t sure what they are up against or if they can keep their family safe. In times of danger, Bianca and Jagger know the only thing they can do is hold onto each other while trying not to admit they are losing control. *****Book #3 in the Heaven Hill Series*****",

        "description": "A Romance of the Republic, published in 1867, was Lydia Maria Child's fourth novel and the capstone of her remarkable literary career. Written shortly after the Civil War, it offered a progressive alternative to Uncle Tom's Cabin. Writer, magazine publisher and outspoken abolititionist, Child defied the norms of gender and class decorum in this novel by promoting interracial marriage as a way blacks and whites could come to view each other with sympathy and understanding. In constructing the tale of fair-skinned Rosa and Flora Royal -- daughters of a slaveowner whose mother was also the daughter of a slaveowner -- Child consciously attempted to counter two popular claims: that racial intermarriage was \"unnatural\" and that slavery was a benevolent institution. But Child's target was not merely racism. Her characters are forced both to reconsider their attitudes toward \"white\" and \"black\" and to question the very foundation of the patriarchal society in which they live.",

        "description": "She’s on top… When superstar actress Claire Jordan researched her role for the Fierce Trilogy movies, she never expected the bond she feels with the author and her romance book club aka The Happy Endings Book Club. Soon Claire finds herself confessing her secret longing for a regular guy—no more egocentric wealthy players—and the book club is all too ready to help. In disguise as a regular girl, she’s all set for a date with book-club-approved Josh Campbell. He’s on top… Billionaire tech CEO Jake Campbell is weary of gold-digging women, especially the glamorous superficial types. So when his identical twin, Josh, calls in a favor, asking Jake to step in as him on a date, Jake figures one of Josh’s cute girl-next-door types might be just what he needs. One night of passion with the sweet girl next door leaves Jake wanting more, except she seems to have vanished. Sometimes a Happy Ending is just the beginning.",

Lillian Brickles bakes the best brownies in town, knows her film noir, and excels at the society page drivel she writes for the Lincolnia Chronicle Gazetteer, yet the most she knows about love is how to spell it. Frank Pinkus, scarred by a long-ago betrayal, is obsessed with revenge. Henry North, the young visitor from Minneapolis, dreams of playing in the big leagues, even though people tell him he never will on account of his physical frailty. And 78-year-old Matthew Macauley is racing to finish his life's work a toe-tapping, flag-waving, please-get-out-of-the-way-of-the-tubas march before the Fourth of July. Everyone's dreams, it turns out, depend on the timely arrival of America's most famous composer/bandmaster. And that's a very big problem. See, the year is 1991, and at the time of these events, the guest of honor Mr. John Philip Sousa himself was known to be resting in a Washington, D.C. cemetery, some 59 years into his eternal slumber. It will take a miracle to satisfy the four dreamers but then, this was the summer of miracles, too.",

        "description": "This eBook edition of \"AN UNSOCIAL SOCIALIST\" has been formatted to the highest digital standards and adjusted for readability on all devices. An Unsocial Socialist, Shaw's last written novel was published in 1887, having been written in 1883. The tale begins with a humorous description of student antics at a girl's school then changes focus to a seemingly uncouth labourer who, it soon develops, is really a wealthy gentleman in hiding from his overly affectionate wife. Tinged with self-satirical overtones this novel shows both the positive and negative aspects of Socialism in a comically paradoxical manner. George Bernard Shaw (1856 - 1950) was an Irish playwright, essayist, novelist and short story writer and wrote more than 60 plays. He is the only person to have been awarded both a Nobel Prize in Literature (1925) and an Academy Award (1938). Excerpt: \"I am expected to be something more than mortal. Everyone else is encouraged to complain, and to be weak and silly. But I must have no feeling. I must be always in the right. Everyone else may be homesick, or huffed, or in low spirits. I must have no nerves, and must keep others laughing all day long.\" Table of Contents: Biography: George Bernard Shaw by G. K. Chesterton An Unsocial Socialist",

Life’s not perfect, but it’s pretty fantastic. Until a shock diagnosis suddenly throws everything off course. But Alex has never been one to back down from a fight. Now single and unemployed, she packs up and moves from her Glasgow hometown to vibrant Birmingham for a fresh start. In a new job, in a new city, she’s learning all over again what’s important in life. Friendship, fun and even romance lie just around the corner – but can Alex get out of her own way and learn to just take a moment, and live? A stunning, uplifting romance for fans of Mhairi McFarlane and Jo Watson. Praise for Take A Moment ‘Honest, hopeful and beautifully written. A must read.’ Sandy Barker, author of One Summer in Santorini ‘Having loved Nina Kaye’s Gin Lover’s Guide, I’ve been itching to get my hands on Take A Moment. Kaye’s humorous yet heartfelt writing is the perfect tonic for tough times.’ Chrissie Manby, author of Three Days in Florence 'Take A Moment is a really thought-provoking and inspirational book. An uplifting, warm-hearted, wonderful read with really relatable characters, that I thoroughly enjoyed.' Kim Nash, author of Escape to Giddywell Grange 'This is so much more than a delightful romcom. Packed with music, fun, 'chance' meetings, liveliness, positive female characters... Rich, lively, heart-warming.' ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Reader review 'Funny, charming, honest and the characters were fabulous. A beautiful read, love your work Nina.' ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Reader review 'Being brave when your whole world tumbles around you is one of the most courageous things and I admired Alex’s strength.

All Love in Bloom novels are written to stand alone and may also be enjoyed as part of the larger series, so dive right into this fun, sexy romance. IN SEASIDE SUNSETS… Jessica Ayers has lived a sheltered life with little more than cello lessons and practices taking up her day. Now a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, she escapes the prim and proper symphony to vacation in the Seaside community in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, and determine if she is living life to the fullest or missing it altogether. For the first time since developing the second largest search engine in the world, billionaire Jamie Reed is taking the summer off. He plans to work from the Cape and spend time with his elderly grandmother—and falling in love is not in his plans. From the moment Jamie and Jessica meet, the attraction is white-hot. Once-overly-focused Jamie can think of little else than sensual, smart, and alluring Jessica, and Jessica discovers a side of herself she never knew existed. But when Jamie’s business encounters trouble and his attorney and best friend intervenes, he proves that the blond beauty is too distracting for Jamie. To make matters worse, it appears that Jessica might not be who she says she is, turning Jamie’s life—and his heart—upside down. In a world where personal information is always one click away, Jamie must decide if he should trust his heart or watch the woman he loves walk away *** SEASIDE SUMMERS Seaside Dreams (Bella) Seaside Hearts (Jenna) Seaside Sunsets (Jamie) Seaside Secrets (Amy) Seaside Nights (Sky) Seaside Embrace (Hunter) Seaside Lovers (Grayson) Seaside Whispers (Matt) Seaside Summers is part of the Love in Bloom romance collection by New York Times & USA Today bestselling and award-winning author Melissa Foster.

        "publishedDate": "1996",
        "description": "The friendship between Herman Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne was perhaps the most famous friendship involving two great American authors. This book proposes that Hawthorne's The Blithedale Romance and Melville's Pierre, both published in 1852, are pivotal to understanding the two men's literary as well as personal relationship and should therefore be read as companion pieces. Both novels dramatize a crisis in the relationship of the two writers that occurred in the summer of 1851 when Melville - whose homoerotic preoccupations have finally become a major critical topic - made some advances toward Hawthorne that were immediately rebuffed. This study argues that both The Blithedale Romance and Pierre provide a significant comment on this crisis in the relationship, and taking into consideration recent directions in gender studies, it also proposes a new reading of the two novels as homoerotic texts. After departing from an exploration of Melville's and Hawthorne's personal relationship and the literary influence that the writers had on each other, author Monika Mueller analyzes gender, genre, and homoerotic crisis in the two works, focusing on the unfolding of their parallel structure after the stage has been set by the failed male friendships in the novels. Mueller reads the two books as texts that encode homoerotic desire. She positions the male friendships in the novels within a framework of reference of other nineteenth-century male friendships in order to show how same-sex desire had to be presented so that it would be allowed to surface. The homoerotic relationships of the male protagonists are permitted to function only as a subtext to the heterosexual love stories and are finally subsumed under a \"love triangle\" involving a woman who becomes the mutual love interest of both men. The fact that Hawthorne and Melville placed The Blithedale Romance and Pierre in the literary genre of the \"sentimental romance\" (which was traditionally reserved for women) further exacerbates this sexual/textual ambiguity. The confusion of literary genre that both novels have in common further comments upon the gender confusion that both authors experienced, and which in its turn ultimately caused them to dramatize a confusion of gender and genre.",

        "description": "In this psychological thriller following Die Smiling, an apparent suicide draws a detective toward a demented killer who likes to play games. His doctors are the best in the world, his father one of the most powerful men in the state. But they couldn’t stop Mikey from succumbing to his darkest demons—the ones inside his head. The ones who told him it was time to end it all . . . It should have been an open-and-shut case, especially since detective Claire Morgan’s lover, Dr. Nicholas Black, recognized Mikey as a former troubled patient. Then Claire finds another body in Mikey’s home. Curled inside an oven, charred beyond recognition, the method of murder mind-boggling . . . Claire’s only lead is a beaded bracelet around each victim’s wrist, believed to ward off the “evil eye.” But by the time she discovers what the dead were afraid of, she’s trapped in a mind game of her own—with a brilliant, sadistic killer. And this time, there’s a method to the madness . . . Praise for Enter Evil “This book was everything I had hoped for and more as it ratchets up the suspense with surprising twists and turns. Linda is a brilliant writer, and I can't wait for more of her books.” —Fresh Fiction",

        "description": "Twenty-one-year-old Felicia is a college student working part-time as a professional Dominatrix. She came to the profession on the advice of an older Dominatrix. As a dominant female, she hopes to come to terms with a traumatic and humiliating event from her past. At just eighteen, she consented to a disciplinary paddling from her school principal. The ensuing media attention resulted in her being almost totally ostracized by her peers. She still suffers from PSTD and feels she's missing out on something she may be afraid to admit, even to herself... that is until one warm spring evening, when she accepts an \"outcall\" from a posh hotel not far from her apartment, she meets a \"client\" of the sort she never expected. Turns out, he never expected a girl like her! Two dominants in the same room? While it’s a practical joke, as their evening progresses, Felicia discovers that not all males calling themselves Dominants are cut from the same cloth. He suggests possibilities she's been missing and an aspect of her personality she may never have quite accepted, until tonight…",

In this charming entertainment, mistaken identities, botched schemes, and hilarious misunderstandings all play a part as Parisian sophistication collides with the affability and simple pleasures of the Great Plains. Touring America was Natalie's idea. But she had not planned on being accompanied on a cross-country bus by her playboy fiancé, Pierre. Nor had they anticipated being stranded in Seldom, Nebraska, population 395. But that is exactly what happens to this French couple, and they quickly find themselves being taken in by the obliging citizens of Seldom: Natalie by Mrs. Christiansen, a retired high school teacher who runs a rooming house for women, and Pierre by Owen, a gas station owner and ambitious winemaker in an unlikely part of the world. And here also, the separated couple become enchanted by the locals. Natalie is soon being wooed by Dick Tupper, a handsome and honest rancher with a rambling farmhouse and lots of wide open space. Pierre falls quickly for Iona, a beautiful, no-nonsense waitress in the local diner. Soon everyone is hatching plots to get what they want: Owen needs help from Pierre's world-class wine business if he is ever going to sell his Nebraska vintage; Pierre wants Iona; Natalie thinks she wants Dick Tupper, but maybe it's Dick who wants Iona, and Natalie who wants Pierre? The fun and surprises are many in this playful romance.",

Scholes and Kellogg argue that such a narrow view obscures the real tradition of narrative literature in the Western world. Examining thework of Joyce, Proust, Mann, Lawrence, Faulkner, and other writers of this century, they consider elements common to all narrative forms, including myth, folktale, epic, romance, allegory, confession, and satire.",

They are reproduced, in most cases, from the actual turn of the century magazine pages in which they first appeared (along with the original illustrations). The modern day reader will experience the same sense of excitement and fascination that his forefathers did in reading these dramatic tales of life and adventure.",

Mckay's vivid, warm evocations of the omnipresent numbers racket, all-night jazz parties and the whole exuberant and cacophonous clash of social movements and ideologies - Black nationalism and industrial unionism as well as incipient Muslim and other heterodox religious formations - provide the context for a fast-paced narrative of love, work, play and revolt in Black America during one of the most stirring periods in US history. Astutely sensitive to the extraordinary vitality and diversity of Black culture, and drawing on the author's experiences in the IWW and the extreme Left of the socialist movement, Harlem Glory reveals Claude McKay at his very best.",

Daphne doesn’t want love, or romance, or sex, or even a relationship. She wants some time alone without casual sex with guys whose names she can’t be bothered to remember in the morning. Too bad her new roommate’s brother is hot, insanely hot, like melt your panties and spread your legs kind of hot. From the moment she sets eyes on Jason Wild, Daphne can’t stop craving the satisfaction she knows she will find in his arms. Jason is not interested in commitment, and Daphne is done with hookups, but it’s only a matter of time before temptation wins. Only, what happens after, when it’s time to walk away? This set contains the first three installments of Serena Grey's Wild Sexy Series. If you like hot men, steamy scenes and panty-melting heat, don't miss this series.",
